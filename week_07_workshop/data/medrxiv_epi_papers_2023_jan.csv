10.1101/2022.12.19.22283694,USES OF THE SKEW-LOGISTIC FUNCTION FOR MULTI-WAVE FUNCTIONS,"The Skew-Logistic (SL) function has been proposed to model a real-life dynamic process which rises monotonically to a peak followed by a monotonic decline. It was introduced to model the first stage of the Covid-19 pandemic to forecast the behaviour of Covid. Then, with different controls and variants, Covid levels rose and fell in what might be called a Multi-Wave (MW) behaviour; with the waves not necessarily the same size. This paper shows how using the SL function for one wave can be modified to model the MW situation. We apply it to two examples. One is to Covid -19, to examine its most recent behaviour. The other is to climate change, the most serious issue of our time. Ensuring that the world simply achieves carbon-equality is not enough. We have to rapidly achieve carbon-negativity to prevent bringing an end to the world as we know it."

DesignProspective cohort study

SettingHispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), US; UK Biobank (UKBB), UK.

Participants7,227 US Hispanic/Latinos without diabetes from HCHS/SOL, including 3,677 participants with prediabetes. 400,149 non-Hispanic whites without diabetes from UKBB, including 16,284 participants with prediabetes.

Main outcome measuresPrediabetes was defined by fasting plasma glucose (fasting glucose) between 100-125 mg/dL, 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT 2h glucose) between 140-199 mg/dL, or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) between 5.7% and 6.5%. Diabetes was defined by fasting glucose levels [&ge;]126 mg/dL, 2h glucose after OGTT [&ge;]200 mg/dL, HbA1c [&ge;]6.5%, current use of anti-diabetic medications, or medical record. Five pPRSs representing various pathways related to T2D were calculated based on 94 T2D-related genetic variants. Health lifestyle score was assessed with five modifiable risk factors, including body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol drinking, physical activity, and diet for T2D.

ResultsUsing K-means consensus clustering on five pRPSs, six clusters of individuals with prediabetes were identified in HCHS/SOL, with each cluster presenting disparate patterns of pPRSs and different patterns of metabolic traits. Except cluster 3 which was not detected, the other five clusters were conformed in participants with prediabetes in UKBB, with each cluster showing the similar patterns of pPRSs to their corresponding cluster in HCHS/SOL. At baseline, proportion of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)/impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and glycemic traits in HCHS/SOL (fasting glucose, OGTT 2h glucose, and HbA1c) were not significantly different across six clusters (P=0.13, P=0.62, P=0.35, P=0.96, respectively). In UKBB, random glucose and HbA1c at baseline did not show significant difference across five clusters (P=0.43, P=0.71, respectively). Although baseline glycemic traits were similar across clusters, cluster 6, which featured a very low proinsulin score, exhibited elevated risk of incident T2D in both cohorts (risk ratio [RR]=1.39, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]=[1.10, 1.76] vs. cluster 1 in HCHS/SOL; hazard ratio [HR]=1.29, 95% CI=[1.00, 1.69] vs. cluster 1 in UKBB; Combined RR/HR=1.34 [1.13, 1.60]). To explain the elevated risk of incident T2D in cluster 6, interactions between proinsulin score and other three pPRSs (Beta-cell score, Lipodystrophy-like score, Liver-lipid score) and sum score were detected (P for interaction=0.001, 0.04, 0.02 and 0.002, respectively). Cluster 5 showed an increased risk of incident T2D in UKBB (HR=1.35 [1.05, 1.75] vs. cluster 1) and in the combined analysis with HCHS/SOL (RR/HR=1.29 [1.08, 1.53]), although its risk of T2D was not significantly different from cluster 1 in HCHS/SOL (RR=1.23 [0.96, 1.57]). Inverse associations between the lifestyle score and risk of T2D were observed across different clusters, with a suggestively stronger association in Cluster 5 compared to Cluster 1, in both cohorts. Cluster 5 showed reduced risk of incident diabetes caused by healthy lifestyle score (RR=0.65 [0.47, 0.89], HR=0.71 [0.62, 0.81], respectively. Combined RR/HR=0.70 [0.62, 0.79]). Among individuals with a healthy lifestyle, those in Cluster 5 had a similar risk of T2D compared to those in Cluster 1 (combined RR/HR=1.03 [0.91-1.18], P>0.05).

ConclusionsThis study identified genetic subtypes of prediabetes which differed in risk of progression to T2D, with two subtypes showing relatively high risk of T2D over time. Favorable relationship between healthy lifestyle and risk of T2D was observed, regardless of their genetic subtypes. Participants in one subtype with higher risk of T2D may realize extra benefits in terms of risk reduction from a healthy lifestyle."
10.1101/2023.01.04.23284196,Tuberculosis Mortalities Among In-patients at a Tertiary Hospital in Zambia Between2018 and 2019 - The Spectrum of Clinical Presentations,"Tuberculosis (TB) has remained one of the most important public health diseases and a leading cause of mortality from a single infectious agent in the world. In-patient mortalities have remained relatively high despite massive investment towards TB elimination. This prompted us to undertake a TB mortality review aimed at understanding the spectrum of clinical presentations in TB mortalities among in-patients in a local hospital set up in Zambia.

Files of 74 in-patient TB related mortalities that had occurred at Kitwe Teaching Hospital over a 12-month period between June 2018 and June 2019 were audited using a structured questionnaire. The descriptive data was analyzed using SPSS v 16.0 statistical software and Microsoft excel 2016.

The audit revealed that 50 (67.6%) of the files were for male patients with a mean age of 39.2 {+/-} 11.6 years. 60(80%) were HIV positive, 60(80%) resided in high-density residential areas. On presentation to hospital, the commonest symptoms included productive cough and fever [31(41.9%) and 30(40.5%) respectively]. HIV positive male patients were presenting in hyperdynamic state (mean pulse rate of 117.2 {+/-} 32.4 per min). Other findings included signs of multi-organ involvement [hypoalbuminemia 9(12.2%), deranged renal function 8(10.8%) and deranged liver enzymes 9(12.2%)] before mortality occurred.

The spectrum of clinical presentations among in-patients with TB in a tertiary hospital include the following; male gender, age younger than 50 years, being HIV positive, residing in a high-density residential area and presenting with unstable hemodynamics. There is a need to focus strategies targeted at strengthening early recognition of clinical instability among admitted TB patients for at-risk populations, including young to middle aged males who are HIV positive."
10.1101/2023.01.04.23284186,The immediate treatment outcomes and cost estimate for managing clinical measles in children admitted at Mulago Hospital: a retrospective cohort study.,"BackgroundOver the recent years, the Ministry of Health in Uganda has reported multiple measles outbreaks in various districts despite the availability of a safe cost effective vaccine. Measles, especially among the unvaccinated, can lead to serious complications including death, while its management heavily burdens the family and health care delivery system. Whereas the cost of measles vaccination is known, the cost of treating measles is unknown. Knowledge of this can inform policy and planning for healthcare services.

MethodA retrospective single cohort study using records review was conducted to determine the immediate treatment outcomes and estimate the health care delivery cost of managing measles among children 0-12 years admitted at Mulago hospital throughout 2018. Demographics, complications, vaccination status, discharge status, duration of hospital stay, type of treatment, supplies used and investigations done were abstracted from the patient charts. The costs of treatment were obtained from the hospital pharmacy price list while the unit cost of utilities, human resource, food and security were obtained from the hospital accounts department. Patients characteristics were summarized descriptively. For all cost information, we reported the mean with standard deviation (SD) and range, and costs information was stratified and presented as direct health care (blood test, radiology and treatment) and direct non health care.

ResultsOut of 536 patient charts, 267 were chosen, 51% were for females and the median age was 1.0 (IQR 0.75-2) years. Sixty-three patients (24%) were immunised, 79 (29%) were not immunized, 56 (21%) were not due for immunisation at the time of hospitalisation while the status of 69 (26%) was not recorded. Median length of hospital stay was 4.0 days (IQR 3.0-7.0) with majority (n=207, 77%) staying < 7 days. There were 30 deaths (11%) with mortality highest among the unimmunised (n= 13, 44%) and severe pneumonia (39.5%) was the commonest complication.

The average cost estimate to the health care delivery system to treat a child with measles was (114.5 USD). Human resource (79.33USD, SD 4.63) and treatment costs (21.98USD, SD 22.77) were the largest expenses.

ConclusionsMortality among children with measles was high and occurrence of complications common. The estimated average direct health care cost of treating a measles case in the National Referral Hospital was considerably high. Further research is required to estimate the cost to the family and society in managing a child with measles."

The persistence of OBI very often leads to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and immunodeficiency. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of OBI and to characterize the incriminated genotypes of the virus.

Material and methodThe plasmas of 252 HBsAg-negative volunteers were used for highlighting the viral DNA by PCR classic. PCR Multiplex using specific primers of 6 genotypes (A to F) was used for characterization.

ResultsA prevalence of 11.9% (30/252) of OBI was obtained with 7.5% in women and 4.4% for men. Genotypes E (60.0%) and A3 (23.3%) were present and genotypes B, C, D, and F were absent. A mixed infection with E/A3 genotypes (16.7%) was observed. AC Anti-HBc was present in 80% of cases OBI.

Discussion/ConclusionThe prevalence of 11.9% of OBI could be related to the level of endemicity of the study area, Burkina Faso being a country with a prevalence of more than 14% of HBV infection. These infections are dominated by the A3 and E genotypes, confirming their importance in chronic HBV infections. The absence of genotypes B and C in cases of OBI constitutes a positive predictive value since their presence is linked to a more rapid evolution of the infection towards HCC."
10.1101/2023.01.04.23284191,"Behavior-change interventions to improve antimicrobial stewardship in human health, animal health, and livestock agriculture: A systematic review","Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an economic, food security, and global health threat that is driven by a multitude of factors including the overuse and misuse of antimicrobials in the human health, animal health, and agriculture sectors. Given the rapid emergence and spread of AMR and the relative lack of development of new antimicrobials or alternative therapies, there is a need to develop and implement non-pharmaceutical AMR mitigation policies and interventions that improve antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) practices across all sectors where antimicrobials are used. We conducted a systematic literature review per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to identify peer-reviewed studies that described behavior-change interventions that aimed to improve AMS and/or reduce inappropriate antimicrobial use in the human health, animal health, and livestock agriculture stakeholders. We identified 301 total publications - 11 in the animal health sector and 290 in the human health sector - and assessed these interventions using metrics across five thematic areas- (1) antimicrobial use (AMU), (2) adherence to clinical guidelines, (3) AMS, (4) AMR, and (5) clinical outcomes. The lack of studies in the animal health sector precluded a meta-analysis. Among studies in the human health sector, 35.7% reported significant (p<0.05) pre- to post-intervention decreases in AMU, 73.7% reported significant improvements in adherence of antimicrobial therapies to clinical guidelines, 45% demonstrated significant improvements in AMS practices, 45.5% reported significant decreases in the proportion of isolates that were resistant to antibiotics or the proportion of patients with drug-resistant infections across 17 antimicrobial-organism combinations, and few studies reported statistically significant changes in clinical outcomes. We did not identify any overarching intervention type nor characteristics associated with successful improvement in AMS, AMR, AMU, adherence, nor clinical outcomes."

We use the electronic health record (EHR)-based study cohort from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) as part of the NIH Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative to characterize reinfection, understand development of Long COVID after reinfection, and compare severity of reinfection with initial infection. We validate previous findings of reinfection incidence (5.9%), the occurrence of most reinfections during the Omicron epoch, and evidence of multiple reinfections. We present novel findings that Long COVID diagnoses occur closer to the index date for infection or reinfection in the Omicron BA epoch. We report lower albumin levels leading up to reinfection and a statistically significant association of severity between first infection and reinfection (chi-squared value: 9446.2, p-value: 0) with a medium effect size (Cramers V: 0.18, DoF = 4)."
10.1101/2023.01.04.23284159,OH-EpiCap: a semi-quantitative tool for the evaluation of One Health epidemiological surveillance capacities and capabilities,"Although international health agencies encourage the development of One Health (OH) surveillance, many systems remain mostly compartmentalized, with limited collaborations among sectors and disciplines. In the framework of the OH European Joint Programme ""MATRIX"" project, a generic evaluation tool called OH-EpiCap has been developed to enable individual institutes/governments to characterize, assess and monitor their own OH epidemiological surveillance capacities and capabilities. The tool is organized around three dimensions: organization, operational activities, and impact of the OH surveillance system; each dimension is then divided into four targets, each including four indicators. A semi-quantitative questionnaire enables the scoring of each indicator, with four levels according to the degree of satisfaction in the studied OH surveillance system. The evaluation is conducted by a panel of surveillance representatives (during a half-day workshop or with a back-and-forth process to reach a consensus). An R Shiny-based web application facilitates implementation of the evaluation and visualization of the results, and includes a benchmarking option. The tool was piloted on several foodborne hazards (i.e. Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria), emerging threats (e.g. antimicrobial resistance) and other zoonotic hazards (psittacosis) in multiple European countries in 2022. These case studies showed that the OH-EpiCap tool supports the tracing of strengths and weaknesses in epidemiological capacities and the identification of concrete and direct actions to improve collaborative activities at all steps of surveillance. It appears complementary to the existing EU-LabCap tool, designed to assess the capacity and capability of European microbiology laboratories. In addition, it provides opportunity to reinforce trust between surveillance stakeholders from across the system and to build a good foundation for a professional network for further collaboration."

10.1101/2022.12.31.22284047,Transitions across Kidney Disease Stages and Association with New-onset Heart Failure: a Population-Based study of 8569 Individuals and 12.6 Years of Follow-up,"BackgroundLimited data exist on transitions across Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) risk stages and association with new-onset heart failure (HF) in the general population.

MethodsData were extacted from the first four clinical examinations of the PREVEND study. Participants were categorized into eGFR and albuminuria risk stages according to KDIGO Guideline. Multi-state model was fitted to estimate the transition rates across consecutive KDIGO risk stages and the association with new-onset HF.

Results8569 participants were included at baseline. During a median follow-up of 12.6 years, 373 participants were diagnosed with new-onset HF and 710 participants had died before new-onset HF. The transition rate from low risk to intermediate risk stage did not differ between women and men; it increased from 0 to 10 transitions per 100 person-years from age 50 to 75 years. The transition rate from intermediate risk to high or very high risk stage increased exponentially with age, with women having lower rates (HR: 0.50, 95%CI: 0.34-0.76). Younger subjects and women were more likely to make a backward transition from intermediate risk to low risk stage. More advanced KDIGO risk stages were associated with increased risk of new-onset HF, and the risk association attenuates with age on the relative scale but strengthens with age on the absolute scale.

ConclusionsSlowing the progression of KDIGO risk stages may result in an important reduction in the incidence of new-onset heart failure in this population of middle-aged subjects."

However, their correlation with chronic hepatitis C-associated cirrhosis complicated by T2DM mellitus is unknown.

AimTo investigate the correlation of PNI, NLR and PLR with chronic hepatitis C-associated cirrhosis complicated by T2DM.They were associated with the prognosis of patients.

MethodsWe investigated 226 patients. Of the patients, 56 cases were with chronic hepatitis C-associated cirrhosis complicated by T2DM mellitus patients (group A), 85 cases were with chronic hepatitis C-associated cirrhosis patients (group B), and 85 cases were with T2DM patients (group C). According to the prognosis of chronic hepatitis C-associated cirrhosis complicated by T2DM after 6 months of treatment, patients were divided into poor prognosis (23 cases) and good prognosis (33 cases). The baseline data and of all patients were analyzed. All data were collected from the database of the hospital patient electronic medical record system.

ResultsA comparison of baseline data among the three groups showed significant differences in age (P value=0.008). The levels of PNI were obvious difference in three groups (P value < 0.01). The level of NLR in the group A was significantly lower than in the group C. The level of NLR in the group B was significantly lower than in the group C and the group A. The level of PNI in the group A was significantly lower than in the group C. The level of PNI in the group A was significantly lower than in the group B. The level of PLR in the group A was significantly lower than in the group C. The level of PLR in the group B was significantly higher than in the group C. NLR, PNI, PLR were significantly different in the good prognosis group and the poor prognosis group (P value < 0.05). We calculated AUC for combined determination of PNI, NLR and PLR, and it showed excellent diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.911,95% CI 0.741-0.985, Sensitivity = 80.00 %, and Specificity = 88.89%).

ConclusionsPNI, NLR and PLR were closely related to the prognosis of chronic hepatitis C-associated cirrhosis complicated by T2DM, and their combined detection had the highest specificity and sensitivity for early prediction of the poor prognosis of chronic hepatitis C-associated cirrhosis complicated by T2DM, which had important clinical value."
10.1101/2020.10.28.20221986,Impacts of Teaching Modality on U.S. COVID-19 Spread in Fall 2020 Semester,"We study the impact of college reopening in Fall 2020 on county-level COVID-19 cases and deaths using the information of 1,076 randomly chosen four- and two-year undergraduate degree-granting colleges from the National Center for Education Statistics. These institutions include public, private nonprofit, and for profit schools from 50 US states and the District of Columbia. We match college and county characteristics using several methods and calculate the average treatment effects of three teaching modalities: in-person, online, and hybrid on COVID-19 outcomes up to two months after college reopening. In pairwise comparison, colleges reopened with in-person teaching mode were found to have about 35 percentage points more cases within 15 days of reopening, compared to those that reopened online, and the gap widens over time at a decreasing rate. Death rates follow the pattern with a time lag. However, colleges with hybrid mode reach up to the rates of in-person mode after some time. We also find that greater endowment and student population, bigger class size, and fewer Republican voters in the county are major predictors of choosing remote teaching modes over in-person."
10.1101/2020.12.01.20241570,Correcting the Reproduction Number for Time-Varying Tests: a Proposal and an Application to COVID-19 in France,"We provide a novel way to correct the effective reproduction number for the time-varying amount of tests, using the acceleration index (Baunez et al., 2021) as a simple measure of viral spread dynamics. Not correcting results in the reproduction number being a biased estimate of viral acceleration and we provide a formal decomposition of the resulting bias, involving the useful notions of test and infectivity intensities. When applied to French data for the COVID-19 pandemic (May 13, 2020 - October 26, 2022), our decomposition shows that the reproduction number, when considered alone, characteristically underestimates the resurgence of the pandemic, compared to the acceleration index which accounts for the time-varying volume of tests. Because the acceleration index aggregates all relevant information and captures in real time the sizable time variation featured by viral circulation, it is a more parsimonious indicator to track the dynamics of an infectious disease outbreak in real time, compared to the equivalent alternative which would combine the reproduction number with the test and infectivity intensities.

However, widespread pandemic fatigue and limited compliance potentially undermine mitigation efforts. To establish a baseline for interventions, we ran a multicountry survey to assess respondents willingness to receive booster vaccination and comply with testing and isolation mandates. The vast majority of survey participants (N=4,594) was willing to adhere to testing (>91%) and rapid isolation (>88%) across the three countries. Pronounced differences emerged in the declared senior adherence to booster vaccination (73% in France, 94% in Belgium, 86% in Italy). Next, we inferred the vaccine-induced population immunity profile at the winter start from prior vaccination data, immunity waning, and declared booster uptake. Integrating survey and estimated immunity data in a branching process epidemic spreading model, we evaluated the effectiveness and costs of current protocols in France, Belgium, and Italy to manage the winter wave. Model results estimate that testing and isolation protocols would confer significant benefit in reducing transmission (17-24%) with declared adherence. Achieving a mitigating level similar to the French protocol, the Belgian protocol would require 30% fewer tests and avoid the long isolation periods of the Italian protocol (average of 6 days vs. 11). A cost barrier to test would significantly decrease adherence in France and Belgium, undermining protocols effectiveness. Simpler mandates for isolation may increase awareness and actual compliance, reducing testing costs, without compromising mitigation. High booster vaccination uptake remains key for the control of the winter wave."

We compared diagnostic tests for PCD between countries worldwide, assessed whether people with PCD recall their tests, and identified factors associated with the use of tests. We used cross-sectional data from COVID-PCD--an international participatory cohort study collecting information directly from people with PCD. The baseline questionnaire inquired about tests used for PCD diagnosis. Using logistic regression, we investigated factors associated with measurement of nasal nitric oxide (nNO), biopsy for electron or video microscopy, and genetic testing. We included data from 747 participants (60% females) from 49 countries worldwide with median age 27 (interquartile range 12-44). Most (92%) reported diagnostic tests for PCD. Participants reported measurements of nNO (342; 49%), biopsy samples (561; 75%), and genetic tests (435; 58%). The reported use of individual tests, such as genetics, varied between countries from 38% in Switzerland to 68% in North America. Participant recall of test type also differed between countries with lowest recall in Switzerland. One-third (232; 36%) of participants reported all three tests (nNO, biopsy, and genetics). Recently diagnosed people reported more tests [nNO odds ratio (OR) 2.2, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.5-3.2; biopsy OR 3.2, 95%CI 2.1-4.9; genetics OR 4.7, 95%CI 3.2-6.9] and those with situs abnormalities fewer tests (nNO OR 0.5, 95%CI 0.4-0.7; biopsy OR 0.5, 95%CI 0.4-0.8; genetics OR 0.7, 95%CI 0.5-0.94). Our results indicate PCD diagnostic testing differed widely around the world and many patients received incomplete diagnostic work-up based only on clinical features or single tests. People diagnosed long ago and those with situs abnormalities possibly benefit from supplementary testing to refine their diagnosis as a prerequisite for personalized medicine."
10.1101/2022.12.31.22284091,Machine Learning Algorithms to Fight the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The ongoing novel COVID-19 global pandemic is one of the health emergencies in 21st century after hundred years of Spanish flu that affected almost all the countries in the world. The objective of this study is to generate STM and LTM real-time out of sample forecasts of the future COVID-19 confirmed and death cases respectively for the top five mostly affected countries in the world namely USA, India, Brazil, Russia and UK. As of January 17, 2021, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with more than 94.5 million confirmed cases and more than 2 million reported deaths worldwide. Due to extreme robust behaviour in the univariate time series data, forecasting of both COVID-19 confirmed and death cases has become the exigent task for the government officials, healthcare workers, economists, corporate leaders, government, decision makers, public-policy makers, and scientific experts to allocate health resources. To solve this problem different hybrid approaches are applied which eliminate both linear and non-linear errors of the time series datasets and the predictions of for these countries will be practical to act as forewarning for all."
10.1101/2023.01.12.23284503,Peri- and Post-natal Risk Factors Associated with Health of Newborns,"Designing prophylactic strategies for newborns requires understanding of the factors that contribute to immunity and resistance to infection. We analyzed 1,892,035 mother-newborn pairs in which both the mother and newborn were observed continuously for at least one year before and after birth. As part of this study, we considered maternal exposures to infections and immune disorders during pregnancy, exposures to anti-infection medications by both mother and newborn, as well as the newborns delivery type and reported complications. According to our analyses, infection rates and immune disorder rates were over-dispersed among newborns. The most consequential factors predicting newborns immune health were preterm birth, with 276.3% and 193.9% risk increases for newborn bacterial infections. Newborn anti-infective prescriptions were associated with considerable increases in risk of diseases affecting immune health, while maternal prescriptions were associated with fewer outcomes and with mixed signs. The Cesarean section mode of delivery, the mothers age, the sex of the newborn, and the mothers exposure to infections all showed significant but smaller effects on the newborns immune health. Female newborn appeared to be better protected against diseases with immune system etiology, except for miscellaneous infections."

However, there has been no causal evidence in real-world clinical data. We aimed to examine the causal effects of L2HGDH inhibition on coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.

MethodsWe used nine L2HGDH-proxied genetic variants associated with blood 2-hydroxyglutarate levels as genetic instruments, and performed two-sample MR analysis using the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D meta-analysis datasets of CAD (60,801 CAD cases and 123,504 controls) and MI (34,541 MI cases and 261,984 controls).

ResultsGenetically proxied inhibition of L2HGDH associated with 2-hydroxyglutarate levels potentially decreased the risk of CAD (odds ratio [OR] 0.486, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.242-0.977, P=0.043) but was not associated with the risk of MI (OR 0.676, 95% CI 0.312-1.463, P=0.320). This potentially causal association between L2HGDH inhibition and CAD was unlikely to be biased by horizontal pleiotropy, whereas there might be a weak instrument bias.

ConclusionOur MR analysis suggests the potential association between genetically proxied inhibition of L2HGDH and CAD. Our findings may have therapeutic implications for L2HGDH inhibitors in CAD, and further large-scale clinical studies are needed."

Research on these topics is lacking in Latin America.

MethodsWe used a time-stratified case-crossover study design with 1,479,950 non-accidental deaths from Mexico City Metropolitan Area for the period of 2004-2019. Daily 1x1 km PM2.5 (median=23.4 g/m3; IQR=13.6 g/m3) estimates from our satellite-based regional model were employed for exposure assessment at the sub-municipality level. Associations between PM2.5 with broad-category (organ-system) and cause-specific mortality outcomes were estimated with distributed lag conditional logistic models. We also fit models stratifying by potential individual-level effect modifiers including; age, sex, and individual SES-related characteristics namely: education, health insurance coverage, and job categories.

ResultsPM2.5 exposure was associated with higher total non-accidental, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, respiratory, and digestive mortality. A 10-g/m3 PM2.5 higher cumulative exposure over one week (lag06) was associated with higher cause-specific mortality outcomes including hypertensive disease [2.28% (95%CI: 0.26%-4.33%)], acute ischemic heart disease [1.61% (95%CI: 0.59%-2.64%)], other forms of heart disease [2.39% (95%CI: -0.35%-5.20%)], hemorrhagic stroke [3.63% (95%CI: 0.79%-6.55%)], influenza and pneumonia [4.91% (95%CI: 2.84%-7.02%)], chronic respiratory disease [2.49% (95%CI: 0.71%-4.31%)], diseases of the liver [1.85% (95%CI: 0.31%-3.41%)], and renal failure [3.48% (95%CI: 0.79%-6.24%)]. No differences in effect size of associations were observed between SES strata.

ConclusionsExposure to PM2.5 was associated with mortality outcomes beyond the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, including specific death-causes from the digestive and genitourinary systems, with no indications of effect modification by individual SES-related characteristics."
10.1101/2023.01.27.23285126,Agent-based modeling and phylogenetic analysis suggests that COVID-19 will remain a low-severity albeit highly transmissible disease,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is still producing hundreds of thousands of cases worldwide. However, the currently dominant Omicron variant (and its sub-variants) have proven to be less virulent than previous dominant variants, resulting in proportionately fewer severe cases, hospitalizations and deaths. Nonetheless, a persistent concern is that new mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may yet produce more virulent variants. In the present study we provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that this is unlikely, and that COVID-19 will remain a low-severity although highly transmissible disease. Three complementary pieces of evidence support our argument. First, empirical observations suggest that the transmission advantage that Omicron (sub)variants enjoy is in large part due to their cell tropism in the upper respiratory tract, which renders them less virulent. Second, when a negative link between transmissibility and virulence is included in agent-based epidemiological models, viruses evolve towards lower virulence. Third, genetic diversification of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that epistasis in the Omicron family reduces the diversity of successful variants. Taken together these observations point to a high likelihood that the severity of COVID-19 will remain sufficiently low for an endemic status to be reached, provided that vaccination campaigns and sensible hygiene and social measures continue worldwide, as suggested by the World Health Organization."

ObjectiveTo assess the associations between pre-existing maternal cardiovascular disease (CVD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disability (ID) in offspring.

DesignPopulation-based cohort study.

SettingSweden and British Columbia (BC), Canada.

ParticipantsSingletons live-born without major malformations between 1990 and 2019. The Swedish Medical Birth Register and the BC Vital Statistics were linked to hospital and physician billing records for identification of exposure and outcomes. All children were followed from age 1 until the outcome, death, emigration, or December 2020.

ExposureA composite of pre-conception maternal CVDs: cerebrovascular disease, arrhythmia, heart failure, valvular, and congenital heart diseases.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresDiagnoses of ADHD, ASD, and ID. The incidence of ADHD, ASD, and ID, comparing offspring of mothers with versus without CVD, was calculated as adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs). These results were compared to models using paternal CVD as negative-control exposure. Fixed-effect meta-analysis was performed to combine the aHRs from Sweden and BC.

ResultsWe analysed 3,587,257 offspring (48.9% female) - 2,699,675 in Sweden and 887,582 in BC. The meta-analysis suggests that compared with offspring of mothers without CVD, offspring of mothers with CVD had 1.15-fold higher aHRs of ADHD (95% CI: 1.10-1.20) and ASD (95% CI: 1.07-1.22). No association was found between maternal CVD and ID. Stratification by maternal CVD subtypes showed increased hazards of ADHD for maternal heart failure (aHR 1.31; 95% CI: 1.02-1.61), cerebrovascular disease (aHR 1.20; 95% CI: 1.08-1.32), congenital heart disease (aHR 1.18; 95% CI: 1.08-1.27), arrhythmia (aHR 1.13; 95% CI: 1.08-1.19), and valvular heart disease (aHR 1.12; 95% CI: 1.00-1.24). Increased hazards of ASD were observed for maternal cerebrovascular disease (aHR 1.25; 95% CI: 1.04-1.46), congenital heart disease (aHR 1.17; 95% CI: 1.01-1.33), and arrythmia (HR 1.12; 95% CI: 1.01-1.21). Paternal CVDs, except for cerebrovascular disease, did not show associations.

Conclusion and RelevancePre-existing maternal CVD was associated with excess risk of ADHD and ASD in offspring. The associations were broadly robust to genetic confounding, warranting further research to identify the underlying intrauterine mechanisms."

Furthermore, the potential effects of the Spring Festival travel rush on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic were depicted.

MethodsThis study uses baseline data from a large cohort to investigate the characteristics of the recent COVID-19 epidemic in Shaanxi province. A cluster sampling method was used to recruit the study participants during the COVID-19 pandemic in Shaanxi province since Dec. 1st, 2022. A total of 44 sampling cluster (11 village in rural areas and 33 residences in urban areas) were chosen for enrollment of study participants. A self-developed questionnaire was applied to data collection of socio-demographic and COVID-19 pandemic related information.

ResultsA total of 14,744 study participants were enrolled in the baseline survey and 12,111 completed survey data were extracted for analysis. The cumulative infection attack rate (IAR) of COVID-19 among the study participants was 84.7%. The cumulative IAR in urban and rural areas were 85.6% and 83.7%, respectively. A peak of COVID-19 self-reported diagnosis could be observed from Dec. 15th, 2022 to Jan. 1st, 2023 in the provincial level. Beside this major peak of the recent epidemic (around Dec.20th, 2022), a small but steep rise could also be identified between Jan 13th to 14th, 2023. Individuals who escaped the first wave of COVID-19 outbreaks may face danger of infection from returnees during the 2023 Spring Festival.

ConclusionAccording to the COVID-19 cumulative IAR data, the herd community was primarily achieved in Shaanxi provinces urban and rural areas. The epidemic in Shaanxi province has been exacerbated by mass population movement during the Spring Festival travel rush in both urban and rural areas. Further surveillance should be performed to monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections."

Risk factors for OA include non-modifiable factors such as age and gender and modifiable factors such as physical activity.

PurposeThis study aimed to construct a soft voting ensemble model to predict OA diagnosis using variables related to individual characteristics and physical activity and to identify important variables in constructing the model through permutation importance.

MethodUsing the RFECV technique, the variables with the best predictive performance were selected among variables, and an ensemble model combining the RandomForest, XGBoost, and LightGBM algorithms was constructed, and the predictive performance and permutation importance of each variable were evaluated.

ResultThe variables selected to construct the model were age, gender, grip strength, and quality of life, and the accuracy of the ensemble model was 0.828. The most important variable in constructing the model was age (0.199), followed by grip strength (0.053), quality of life (0.043), and gender (0.034).

ConclusionThe performance of the model for predicting OA was relatively good, and if this model is continuously used and updated, this model could readily be used to predict OA diagnosis and the predictive performance of OA may be further improved."
10.1101/2023.01.27.23284540,Association between APOL1 risk variants and progression from infection to sepsis,"BackgroundTwo risk variants in the apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) have been associated with increased susceptibility to sepsis in Black patients. However, it remains unclear whether APOL1 high-risk genotypes are associated with occurrence of either sepsis or sepsis-related phenotypes in patients hospitalized with infections, independent of their association with pre-existing severe renal disease.

MethodsA retrospective cohort study of 2,242 Black patients hospitalized with infections. We assessed whether carriage of APOL1 high-risk genotypes was associated with the risk of sepsis and sepsis-related phenotypes in patients hospitalized with infections. The primary outcome was sepsis; secondary outcomes were short-term mortality and organ failure related to sepsis.

ResultsOf 2,242 Black patients hospitalized with infections, 565 developed sepsis. Patients with high-risk APOL1 genotypes had a significantly increased risk of sepsis (odds ratio [OR]=1.29 [95% CI, 1.00-1.67; p=0.047]); however, this association was not significant after adjustment for pre-existing severe renal disease (OR=1.14 [95% CI, 0.88-1.48; p=0.33]), nor after exclusion of those patients with pre-existing severe renal disease (OR=0.99 [95% CI, 0.70-1.39; p=0.95]. APOL1 high-risk genotypes were significantly associated with the renal dysfunction component of the Sepsis-3 criteria (OR=1.64 [95% CI, 1.21-2.22; p=0.001], but not with other sepsis-related organ dysfunction or short-term mortality. The association between high-risk APOL1 genotypes and sepsis-related renal dysfunction was markedly attenuated by adjusting for pre-existing severe renal disease (OR=1.36 [95% CI, 1.00-1.86; p=0.05]) and was nullified after exclusion of patients with pre-existing severe renal disease (OR=1.16 [95% CI, 0.74-1.81; p=0.52]).

ConclusionAPOL1 high-risk genotypes were associated with an increased risk of sepsis; however, this increased risk was attributable predominantly to pre-existing severe renal disease.

10.1101/2023.01.24.23284885,Impact of vaccination and risk factors on COVID-19 mortality amid delta surge in Libya: a single centre cohort study,"BackgroundThe Delta variant has led to a surge in COVID-19 cases in Libya, making it crucial to investigate the impact of vaccination on mortality rates among hospitalized patients and critically ill.

AimsTo study risk factors and COVID-19 mortality rates among unvaccinated and vaccinated adults during delta wave at a single COVID-19 care centre in Tripoli, Libya.

MethodsThe study involved two independent cohorts (n=341). One cohort was collected retrospectively from May 2021-August 2021 and the second cohort was prospectively collected from August 2021-October 2021 and most of them were during the Delta wave. The two cohorts were merged and analysed as one group.

ResultsMost patients were male (60.5%) and 53.3% were >60 years. The vast majority of admitted patients did not have previous COVID-19 infection (98.9%) and were unvaccinated (90.3%). Among vaccinated, 30 patients had one dose and only 3 had two doses. Among patients who received one dose, 58.1% (18/31) died and 41.9% (13/31) survived. Most patients (72.2%) had a pre-existing medical condition. Multivariable prediction model showed that age >60 years was significantly associated with death (odds ratio=2.328, CI 1.456-3.724, p-value=<0.0001).

ConclusionPrevious infection or full vaccination against COVID-19 significantly reduces hospitalization and death, as most admitted patients were unvaccinated and not previously infected. However, a single vaccine dose may not be adequate, especially for older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions. High-risk older patients with comorbidities should be fully vaccinated and offered up to date bivalent COVID-19 booster doses."

Recent expansion of X-ray screening is leading to increased identification of this group. We set out to synthesise the evidence for treatment to prevent progression to culture-positive disease.

METHODSWe searched for prospective trials evaluating the efficacy of TB regimens against placebo, observation, or alternative regimens, for the treatment of adults and children with radiographic evidence of TB but culture-negative respiratory samples. Databases were searched up to 18 Oct 2022. Study quality was assessed using ROB 2.0 and ROBINS-I. The primary outcome was progression to culture-positive TB. Meta-analysis with a random effects model was conducted to estimate pooled efficacy.

RESULTSWe included 13 trials (32,568 individuals) conducted between 1955 and 2018. Radiographic and bacteriological criteria for inclusion varied. 19.1% to 57.9% of participants with active x-ray changes and no treatment progressed to culture-positive disease. Progression was reduced with any treatment (6 studies, risk ratio [RR] 0.27, 95%CI 0.13-0.56); multi-drug TB treatment (RR 0.11, 95%CI 0.05 - 0.23), was significantly more effective than isoniazid treatment (RR 0.63, 95%CI 0.35-1.13) (p=0.0002).

DISCUSSIONMulti-drug regimens were associated with significantly reduced risk of progression to TB disease for individuals with radiographically apparent, but culture-negative TB. However, most studies were old, conducted prior to the HIV epidemic and with outdated regimens. New clinical trials are required to identify the optimal treatment approach.

10.1101/2023.01.25.23284831,Spatiotemporal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 lineages during 2020-2021 in Pernambuco - Brazil,"In recent years, the SARS-CoV-2 viruses emerged and spread around the world, leaving a large death toll and long-lasting impact on survivors. As of January 2023, Brazil is still among the countries with the highest number of registered deaths. This continental-size and pluralistic country experienced a heterogenous implementation of non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions which, associated with large socioeconomic differences between the country regions, has led to distinct virus spread dynamics across the country. Here we investigate the spatiotemporal dispersion of emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages and its dynamics in distinct epidemiological scenarios in the first two years of the pandemics in the Pernambuco state (Northeast Brazil). We generated a total of 1389 new SARS-CoV-2 genomes from June 2020 to August 2021 covering all major regions of the state. This sampling captured the arrival, communitary transmission and the circulation of the B1.1, B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 lineages in the first eight months of the pandemics, the emergence of the former variant of interest P.2 and the emergence and fast replacement of all previous variants by the more transmissible variant of concern P.1 (Gamma) lineage. Based on the incidence and lineage spread pattern we observed that there was an East-to-West to inner state pattern of transmission which is in agreement with the transmission of more populous metropolitan areas to medium and small size country-side cities in the state. Such transmission patterns may be partially explained by the main routes of traffic across municipalities in the state. Nevertheless, inter-state traffic was also another important source of lineage introduction and spread into the state. Our results highlight that the fine grained intrastate analysis of lineages and incidence spread can provide actionable insights for planning future non-pharmacological intervention for air-borne transmissible human pathogens."
10.1101/2023.01.26.23285075,Effects of Mitigation and Control Policies in Realistic Epidemic Models Accounting for Household Transmission Dynamics,"BackgroundCompartmental infectious disease (ID) models are often used to evaluate non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccines. Such models rarely separate within-household and community transmission, potentially introducing biases in situations where multiple transmission routes exist. We formulated an approach that incorporates household structure into ID models, extending the work of House and Keeling.

DesignWe developed a multi-compartment susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-susceptible-vaccinated (MC-SEIRSV) modeling framework, allowing non-exponentially distributed duration in Exposed and Infectious compartments, that tracks within-household and community transmission. We simulated epidemics that varied by community and household transmission rates, waning immunity rate, household size (3 or 5 members), and numbers of Exposed and Infectious compartments (1-3 each). We calibrated otherwise identical models without household structure to the early phase of each parameter combinations epidemic curve. We compared each model pair in terms of epidemic forecasts and predicted NPI and vaccine impacts on: the timing and magnitude of the epidemic peak and on its total size. Meta-analytic regressions characterized the relationship between household structure inclusion and the size and direction of biases.

ResultsOtherwise similar models with and without household structure produced equivalent early epidemic curves. However, forecasts from models without household structure were biased. Without intervention, they were upward-biased on peak size and total epidemic size, with biases also depending on the number of Exposed and Infectious compartments. Model-estimated NPI effects of a 60% reduction in community contacts on peak time and size were systematically overestimated without household structure. Biases were smaller with a 20% reduction NPI. Because vaccination impacted both community and household transmission, their biases were smaller.

ConclusionsID models without household structure can produce biased outcomes in settings where within-household and community transmission differ."

This paper employs a novel approach to analyze the tempo-spatial dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. First, we base the analysis on a composite indicator of pandemic severity to gain a more robust understanding of the temporal dynamics of the pandemic. Second, we subdivide the pandemic during the years 2020 and 2021 into fifteen phases, each with a coherent trend of pandemic severity. Third, we analyze the patterns of spatial association during each phase. Fourth, similar types of trajectories of pandemic severity among all German counties were identified through hierarchical clustering. The results imply that the hotspots and cold spots of the first four waves of the pandemic were relatively stationary in space so that the pandemic moved in time but less in space."

Cognitive function was measured using an average of the standardized z-scores of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimers Disease Word Learning and delayed recall tests, the Animal Fluency Test, and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Latent class analysis of family income, education, occupation, health insurance, and food security was used to define composite SES (low, medium, high). A healthy lifestyle score was calculated based on smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and the Healthy-Eating-Index-2015. In survey-weighted multivariable linear regressions, participants with 3 or 4 healthy behaviors had 0.07 (95% CI: 0.005, 0.14) standard deviation higher composite cognitive z-score, relative to those with one or no healthy behavior. Participants with high SES had 0.37 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.46) standard deviation higher composite cognitive z-score than those with low SES. No statistically significant interaction was observed between healthy lifestyle score and SES. Our findings suggested that higher healthy lifestyle scores and higher SES were associated with better cognitive function among older adults in the United States."
10.1101/2023.01.26.23285047,Difficulty with Mobility among the Aged in Ghana: Evidence from Wave 2 of the World Health Organizations study on Global Ageing and Adult Health,"BackgroundThe recent decline in mortality, increase in life expectancy and technological and scientific advancements have led to an increasingly ageing population. About 727 million people globally were aged 65 or more in 2020, and 1 in 6 people will be age 65 years or above by 2050. About 7% of Ghanas population was over 60 years in 2010, and projected to be 12% by 2050. However, the aged are confronted with degenerative conditions that translate into difficulty with mobility. The study was conducted to investigate the difficulty with mobility among the aged in Ghana.

MethodsThe study utilised a cross-sectional dataset of the 2014/2015 (wave 2) Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health and included 1,848 participants aged [&ge;]50 years. The survey command was applied to adjust for sampling biases and the design of the study. At 5% alpha level, a chi-square test of independence was conducted to determine the association between dependent and independent variables. At 95% confidence interval and 5% alpha level, three-level multilevel logistic regression models were performed. The fixed-effects were presented in odds ratio and the random effects were presented using the Intra-Class Correlation. All analysis were performed using STATA statistical software version 16.0.

ResultsOut of the 1,848 participants, 62.3% had difficulty with mobility. Additionally, age (80 and above) [AOR=4.70, 95%CI=2.34 - 9.43], difficulty performing household activities [AOR=6.96, 95%CI=5.03 - 9.64], experiencing bodily pains [AOR=3.21, 95%CI=1.81 - 5.60] and bodily discomfort [AOR=3.39, 95%CI=1.91 - 5.99] and difficulty with vision [AOR=1.70, 95%CI=1.18 - 2.43] had higher odds of difficulty with mobility. However, engaging in vigorous activities [AOR=0.44, 95%CI=0.32 - 0.63] and having good health [AOR=0.41, 95%CI=0.19 - 0.88] were protective of difficulty with mobility.

ConclusionThe study concludes that the aged in Ghana had higher prevalence (62.3%) of difficulty with mobility which is associated with age (80 and above), difficulty performing household activities, bodily pains and discomfort, and difficulty with vision. This suggests the need to provide support and assistive devices for the aged and provide geriatric care including recreational fields and care homes to address the health and physical needs of the aged in Ghana."
10.1101/2022.07.24.22277978,Genomic epidemiology reveals the dominance of Hennepin County in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Minnesota from 2020-2022,"SARS-CoV-2 has had an unprecedented impact on human health and highlights the need for genomic epidemiology studies to increase our understanding of virus evolution and spread, and to inform policy decisions. We sequenced viral genomes from over 22,000 patient samples tested at Mayo Clinic Laboratories between 2020-2022 and use Bayesian phylodynamics to describe county and regional spread in Minnesota.

The earliest introduction into Minnesota was to Hennepin County from a domestic source around January 22, 2020; six weeks before the first confirmed case in the state. This led to the virus spreading to Northern Minnesota, and eventually, the rest of the state. International introductions were most abundant in Hennepin (home to the Minneapolis/St. Paul International (MSP) airport) totaling 45 (out of 107) over the two-year period. Southern Minnesota counties were most common for domestic introductions with 19 (out of 64), potentially driven by bordering states such as Iowa and Wisconsin as well as Illinois which is nearby. Hennepin also was, by far, the most dominant source of in-state transmissions to other Minnesota locations (n=772) over the two-year period.

We also analyzed the diversity of the location source of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in each county and noted the timing of state-wide policies as well as trends in clinical cases. Neither the number of clinical cases or major policy decisions, such as the end of the lockdown period in 2020 or the end of all restrictions in 2021, appeared to have impact on virus diversity across each individual county.

ImportanceWe analyzed over 22,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of patient samples tested at Mayo Clinic Laboratories during a two-year period in the COVID-19 pandemic that included Alpha, Delta, and Omicron VoCs to examine the roles and relationships of Minnesota virus transmission.

We found that Hennepin County, the most populous county, drove the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the state after including the formation of earlier clades including 20A, 20C, and 20G, as well as variants of concern Alpha and Delta. We also found that Hennepin County was the source for most of the county-to-county introductions after its initial introduction with the virus in early 2020 from an international source, while other counties acted as transmission ""sinks"". In addition, major policies such as the end of the lockdown period in 2020 or the end of all restrictions in 2021, did not appear to have an impact on virus diversity across individual counties."
10.1101/2022.10.02.22280623,Effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir against hospital admission or death: a cohort study in a large US healthcare system,"BackgroundIn the United States, oral nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) is authorized for use among patients aged [&ge;]12 years with mild-to-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection who are at risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization. However, effectiveness under current real-world prescribing practices in outpatient settings is unclear.

MethodsWe undertook a matched observational cohort study of non-hospitalized cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection to compare outcomes among those who received or did not receive nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within the Kaiser Permanente Southern California healthcare system. Cases were matched on testing date, age, sex, clinical status (including care received, presence or absence of acute COVID-19 symptoms at testing, and time from symptom onset to testing), history of vaccination, Charlson comorbidity index, prior-year healthcare utilization, and body mass index. Primary analyses evaluated effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in preventing hospital admission or death within 30 days after a positive test. Secondary analyses evaluated effectiveness against intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, or death within 60 days after a positive test. We measured treatment effectiveness as (1-adjusted hazards ratio [aHR])x100%, estimating the aHR via Cox proportional hazards models.

ResultsAnalyses included 7,274 nirmatrelvir-ritonavir recipients and 126,152 non-recipients with positive results from SARS-CoV-2 tests undertaken in outpatient settings between 8 April and 7 October, 2022. Overall, 114,208 (85.6%) and 81,739 (61.3%) of 133,426 participants had received [&ge;]2 and [&ge;]3 COVID-19 vaccine doses, respectively. A total of 111,489 (83.6% of 133,426) cases were symptomatic at the point of testing, with 5,472 (75.2% of 7,274) treatment recipients and 84,657 (67.1% of 126,152) non-recipients testing within 0-5 days after symptom onset. Effectiveness in preventing hospital admission or death within 30 days after a positive test was 79.6% (95% confidence interval: 33.9% to 93.8%) for cases dispensed nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 0-5 days after symptom onset; within the subgroup of cases tested 0-5 days after symptom onset and dispensed treatment on the day of their test, effectiveness was 89.6% (50.2% to 97.8%).

Effectiveness declined to 43.8% (-33.3% to 81.7%) for treatment course dispensed [&ge;]6 days after symptom onset or to cases who were not experiencing acute clinical symptoms. Overall, for cases dispensed treatment at any time within their clinical course, effectiveness was 53.6% (6.6% to 77.0%). Effectiveness in preventing the secondary endpoint of intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, or death within 60 days after a positive test was 89.2% (-25.0% to 99.3%) for cases dispensed treatment 0-5 days after symptom onset and 84.1% (18.8% to 96.9%) for cases dispensed treatment at any time. Subgroup analyses identified similar effectiveness estimates among cases who had received [&ge;]2 or [&ge;]3 COVID-19 vaccine doses.

The effects of past Toxoplasma and Borrelia infections on human personality and cognitive performance are not mediated by impaired health,"Bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi s. l. and even more the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii are known to affect the behavior of their animal and human hosts. Both pathogens infect a significant fraction of human population, and both survive in the hosts body for a long time. The resulting latent infections used to be considered clinically asymptomatic. In the last decade, however, numerous studies have shown that this view may be wrong and both infections can have various adverse effects on human health. Their specific behavioral effects may thus be merely side effects of the general impairment of patients health. We tested this hypothesis on a cohort of 7,762 members of internet population using a two-hour-long survey consisting of a panel of questionnaires and performance tests. Our findings confirmed that subjects infected with Toxoplasma were in worse physical and mental health and those infected with Borrelia were in worse physical health than corresponding controls. The infected and noninfected subjects also differed in several personality traits (conscientiousness, pathogen disgust, injury disgust, Machiavellianism, narcissism, tribalism, anti-authoritarianism, intelligence, reaction time, and precision). Majority of the behavioral effects associated with Borrelia infection were the same as those associated with Toxoplasma infection, but some dramatically differed (e.g., performance in the Stroop test). Path analyses and nonparametric partial Kendall correlation tests showed that these effects were not mediated by impaired health of the infected individuals. The results thus contradict predictions of the side effects hypothesis."

We have previously identified several hundred circulating RNAs that were differentially expressed in pre-diagnostic serum samples from TGCT cases when compared to healthy controls. In this study we performed network preservation analyses of pre-diagnostic serum mRNA and miRNA. Hub genes, enriched functional pathways, and regulatory feature prediction were identified for all TGCT, seminoma, and non-seminoma cases separately, compared to controls. We identified UBCA1, RCC1, FMR1, OSA3, and UBE2W as hub genes associated with TGCT. The genes OSA3 and UBE2W have previously been associated with testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS) disorders. Previously described TGCT susceptibility genes TEX14, NARS2, and G3BP2 were identified as hub genes in both seminoma and non-seminoma networks. Furthermore, network module analysis showed prediction of transcription factors for oestrogen-related receptors. The overlap between network hub genes and TGCT susceptibility genes indicates a role in the progression from germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS) to TGCT that should be further investigated."

We aim to establish whether impaired glucose tolerance (as measured by fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and fasting insulin) and cardiovascular disease risk (as measured by LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure) are causally related to infertility (having tried to conceive for [&ge;] 12 months or used assisted reproduction technologies to conceive) by Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses in women and men.

MethodsWe conducted two-sample MR analyses, in which we used genome-wide association summary data that were publicly available for the cardiometabolic risk factors, and sex specific genome-wide association studies of infertility conducted in the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (68,882 women [average age 30, involved in 81,682 pregnancies] and 47,474 of their male partners [average age 33, 55,744 pregnancies]). We applied the inverse variance weighted method with random effects to pool data across variants and a series of sensitivity analyses to explore genetic instrument validity (we checked the robustness of genetic instruments and the lack of unbalanced horizontal pleiotropy, and we used methods that are robust to population stratification). Findings were corrected for multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni method (8 exposures: p-value < 0.00625).

ResultsIn women, increases in genetically determined fasting insulin levels were associated with greater odds of infertility (+1 log(pmol/L): OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.18, p-value = 0.003). The results were robust in the sensitivity analyses exploring the validity of MR assumptions and the role of pleiotropy of other cardiometabolic risk factors. There was also evidence of higher glucose and glycated hemoglobin in women (and possibly higher fasting insulin in men) causing infertility, but findings were imprecise and did not pass our p-value threshold for multiple testing. Results for lipids and blood pressure were close to the null, suggesting that these did not cause infertility.

MethodA cohort was selected from German routine health care data covering 38.9 million individuals. Based on documented diagnoses, we identified individuals with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 through December 31, 2020. Patients were matched 1:3 to control patients without COVID-19. Both groups were followed up until June 30, 2021. We used the four quarters preceding the index date until the end of follow-up to analyze the onset of autoimmune diseases during the post-acute period. Incidence rates (IR) per 1000 person-years were calculated for each outcome and patient group. Poisson models were deployed to estimate the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of developing an autoimmune disease conditional on a preceding diagnosis of COVID-19.

ResultsIn total, 641,704 patients with COVID-19 were included. Comparing the incidence rates in the COVID-19 (IR=15.05, 95% CI: 14.69-15.42) and matched control groups (IR=10.55, 95% CI: 10.25-10.86), we found a 42.63% higher likelihood of acquiring autoimmunity for patients who had suffered from COVID-19. This estimate was similar for common autoimmune diseases, such as Hashimoto thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, or Sjogren syndrome. The highest IRR was observed for autoimmune disease of the vasculitis group. Patients with a more severe course of COVID-19 were at a greater risk for incident autoimmune diseases.

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with an increased risk of developing new-onset autoimmune diseases after the acute phase of infection."
10.1101/2023.01.02.23284123,Early risk-assessment of pathogen genomic variants emergence,"Accurate, reliable, and timely estimates of pathogen variant risk are essential for informing public health responses. Unprecedented rates of genomic sequencing have generated new insights into variant dynamics. However, estimating the fitness advantage of a novel variant shortly after emergence, or its dynamics more generally in data-sparse settings, remains difficult. This challenge is exacerbated in countries where surveillance is limited or intermittent. To stabilize inference in these data-sparse settings, we develop a hierarchical modeling approach to estimate variant fitness advantage and prevalence by pooling data across geographic regions. We demonstrate our method by reconstructing SARS-CoV-2 BA.5 variant emergence, and assess performance using retrospective, out-of-sample validation. We show that stable and robust estimates can be obtained even when sequencing data are sparse. Finally, we discuss how this method can inform risk assessment of novel variants and provide situational awareness on circulating variants for a range of pathogens and use-cases."

This study investigated the risk of GBS after vaccination with anti-COVID-19 vaccines (BNT162b2/Tozinameran; mRNA-1273/Elasomeran, ChAdOx1-S and Ad26.COV2-S) in the population aged [&ge;]12 years in Italy.

MethodsWe conducted a self-controlled case series study (SCCS) using national data on COVID-19 vaccination linked to emergency care/hospital discharge databases. The outcome was the first diagnosis of GBS between 27 December 2020 and 30 September 2021.

Exposure risk period were days 0 (vaccination day) through 42 days following each of the 2 vaccine doses. The remaining periods were considered as non at risk (baseline) period.

The SCCS model, adapted to event-dependent exposures, was fitted using unbiased estimating equations to estimate relative incidences (RIs) and excess of cases (EC) per 100,000 vaccinated by dose and vaccine product. Calendar period was included as time-varying confounder in the model.

ResultsThe study included 15,986,009 persons who received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine. During the 42-day risk interval there were a total of 67 cases of GBS after the first dose and 41 cases after the second dose. In the 42-day risk interval, increased risks were observed after the administration of first dose (RI=6.83; 95% CI 2.14-21.85) and second dose (RI=7.41; 95% CI 2.35-23.38) for mRNA-1273 vaccine, corresponding to 0.4 and 0.3 EC per 100,000 vaccinated, respectively. Increased risk was also observed after the first dose of ChAdOx1-S vaccine (RI=6.52; 95% CI 2.88-14.77), corresponding to 1.0 EC per 100,000 vaccinated. There was no evidence of increased risk of GBS after vaccination with BNT162b2 and Ad26.COV2-S vaccines.

In the subgroup analysis by sex an increased risk of GBS was observed among both males and females after mRNA-1273 vaccine. in males an increased risk was observed after the first dose, with a borderline significance (RI=5.26; 95% CI 0.94-29.42; p=0.06) and the second dose (RI=16.50; 95% CI 3.01-90.56) and in females after the first dose (RI=13.44; 95% CI 2.83-63.80). There was also evidence of an increased risk after a first dose of ChAdOx1-S in males (RI=4.94; 95% CI 1.84-13.28) and females (RI=7.14; 95% CI 1.94-26.19).

In the subgroup analysis by age, there was evidence of an increased risk of GBS with mRNA-1273 vaccine among those aged [&ge;]60 years after the first (RI=8.03; 95% CI 2.08-31.03) and second dose (RI=7.71; 95% CI 2.38-24.97). After a first dose of ChAdOx1-S there was evidence of an increased risk of GBS in those aged 40-59 (RI=4.50; 95% CI 1.37-14.79) and in those aged [&ge;]60 years (RI=6.84; 95% CI 2.56-18.28). There was no evidence of increased risk of GBS after vaccination with BNT162b2 and Ad26.COV2-S vaccines in the subgroup analysis by age and sex.

Study limitations include that the outcome was not validated through review of clinical records, the possibility of time-dependent residual confounding and the imprecision of the obtained estimates in the subgroup analysis due to the very low number of events.

ConclusionsIt is important the continuous monitoring of the suspected adverse events of the COVID-19 vaccines as key component of any vaccination program. Results from this large SCCS study showed an increased risk of GBS after first and second dose of mRNA-1273 and first dose of ChAdOx1-S. However, these findings were compatible with a small number of EC. Our data are reassuring regarding BNT162b and Ad26.COV2-S vaccines with respect to GBS outcome. No increased risk of GBS was detected following each of BNT162b vaccine dose nor any increased risk after Ad26.COV2-S vaccine dose."
10.1101/2023.01.19.23284764,Comparative effectiveness of the bivalent BA.4-5 and BA.1 mRNA-booster vaccines in the Nordic countries,"BackgroundData on the comparative vaccine effectiveness (CVE) of the bivalent mRNA-booster vaccines containing the original SARS-CoV-2 and omicron BA.4-5 and BA.1 subvariants are limited.

MethodsIn a period of BA.4-5 subvariants predominance, we estimated the CVE of the bivalent Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech) and Spikevax (Moderna) BA.4-5 and BA.1 mRNA-booster vaccines given as a fourth dose in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. From 1 July 2022 to 12 December 2022, we conducted nationwide cohort analyses using target trial emulation to compare risks of Covid-19 hospitalization and death in four-dose (second booster) with three-dose (first booster) vaccinated and between four-dose vaccinated individuals.

ResultsCompared with having received three vaccine doses, receipt of a bivalent BA.4-5 booster as a fourth dose was associated with a country-combined CVE against Covid-19 hospitalization of 80.5% (95% confidence interval, 69.5% to 91.5%). The corresponding CVE for bivalent BA.1 boosters was 74.0% (68.6% to 79.4%). CVE against Covid-19 death was 77.8% (48.3% to 100%) and 80.1% (72.0% to 88.2%) for bivalent BA.4-5 and BA.1 boosters as a fourth dose, respectively. The CVE of bivalent BA.4-5 vs. BA.1 boosters were 32.3% (10.6% to 53.9%) for Covid-19 hospitalization and 12.3% (-36.1% to 60.7%) for death (the latter estimable in Denmark only).

ConclusionsVaccination with bivalent BA.4-5 or BA.1 mRNA-booster vaccines as a fourth dose was associated with increased protection against Covid-19 hospitalization and death during a period of BA.4-5 predominance. Bivalent BA.4-5 boosters conferred moderately greater vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19 hospitalization compared with bivalent BA.1 boosters."
10.1101/2023.01.18.23284739,Effectiveness of Vaccination and Previous Infection Against Omicron Infection and Severe Outcomes in Children Under 12 Years of Age,"BackgroundData on the protection conferred by Covid-19 vaccination and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection against omicron infection and severe outcomes in children can inform prevention strategies.

MethodsWe obtained vaccination records and clinical outcomes for 1,368,721 North Carolina residents 11 years of age or younger from October 29, 2021 to January 6, 2023. We used Cox regression to estimate the time-varying effects of primary and booster vaccination and previous infection on the risks of omicron infection, hospitalization, and death.

ResultsFor children 5-11 years of age, the effectiveness of primary vaccination against infection was 59.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 58.5 to 61.2), 33.7% (95% CI, 32.6 to 34.8), and 14.9% (95% CI, 12.3 to 17.5) at 1, 4 and 10 months after the first dose; the effectiveness of a monovalent or bivalent booster dose after 1 month was 24.4% (95% CI, 14.4 to 33.2) or 76.7% (95% CI, 45.7 to 90.0); and the effectiveness of omicron infection against reinfection was 79.9% (95% CI, 78.8 to 80.9) and 53.9% (95% CI, 52.3 to 55.5) after 3 and 6 months, respectively. For children 0-4 years of age, the effectiveness of primary vaccination against infection was 63.8% (95% CI, 57.0 to 69.5) and 58.1% (95% CI, 48.3 to 66.1) at 2 and 5 months after the first dose, and the effectiveness of omicron infection against reinfection was 77.3% (95% CI, 75.9 to 78.6) and 64.7% (95% CI, 63.3 to 66.1) after 3 and 6 months, respectively. For both age groups, vaccination and previous infection had better effectiveness against hospitalization and death than against infection.

ConclusionsCovid-19 vaccination was effective against omicron infection and severe outcomes in children under the age of 12 years, although the effectiveness decreased over time. Bivalent boosters were more effective than monovalent boosters. Immunity acquired via omicron infection was very high and waned gradually over time."

Although such reports can support some evidence-based decisions, these are of limited use if the geographical distribution of morbidity cannot be identified. This study estimates the spatial rate of Acute respiratory infections (ARI) in census districts in Cucuta -Colombia, using an analysis of the spatial distribution of health services providers. The spatial scope (geographical area of influence) of each health service was established from their spatial distribution and the population covered. Three levels of spatial aggregation were established considering the spatial scope of primary, intermediate and tertiary health services providers. The ARI cases per census district were then calculated and mapped using the distribution of cases per health services provider and the proportion of population per district in each level respectively. Hotspots of risk were identified using the Local Morans I statistic. There were 98 health services providers that attended 8994, 18450 and 91025 ARI cases in spatial levels 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Higher spatial rates of ARI were found in districts in central south; northwest and northeast; and southwest Cucuta with hotspots of risk found in central and central south and west and northwest Cucuta. The method used allowed overcoming the limitations of health data lacking area of residence information to implementing epidemiological analyses to identify at risk communities. This methodology can be used in socioeconomic contexts where geographic identifiers are not attached to health statistics."

ObjectiveTo determine overdose mortality for specific drug categories across the lifespan of males and females, using a nationally representative state-level sample.

DesignState-level analyses of nationally representative epidemiological data on overdose mortality for specific drug categories, across 10-year age bins (age range: 15-74).

SettingPopulation-based study of Multiple Cause of Death 2020-2021 data from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC WONDER platform).

ParticipantsDecedents in the United States in 2020-2021

Main outcome measuresThe main outcome measure was sex-specific rates of overdose death (per 100,000) for: synthetic opioids excluding methadone (ICD-10 code: T40.4; predominantly fentanyl), heroin (T40.1), psychostimulants with potential for misuse, excluding cocaine (T43.6, predominantly methamphetamine; labeled ""psychostimulants"" hereafter), and cocaine (T40.5). Multiple regression analyses were used to control for ethnic-cultural background, household net worth, and sex-specific rate of misuse of the relevant substances (from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2018-2019).

ResultsFor each of the drug categories assessed, males had greater overall overdose mortality than females, after controlling for rates of drug misuse. The mean male/female sex ratio of mortality rate for the separate drug categories was relatively stable across jurisdictions: synthetic opioids (2.5 [95%CI, 2.4-2.7]), heroin, (2.9 [95%CI, 2.7-3.1], psychostimulants (2.4 [95%CI, 2.3-2.5]), and cocaine (2.8 [95%CI, 2.6-2.9]). With data stratified in 10-year age bins, the sex difference generally survived adjustment for state-level ethnic-cultural and economic variables, and for sex-specific misuse of each drug type (especially for bins in the 25-64 age range). For synthetic opioids, the sex difference survived adjustment across the lifespan (i.e., 10-year age bins ranging from 15-74), including adolescence, adulthood and late adulthood.

Conclusions and RelevanceThe robustly greater overdose mortality in males versus females for synthetic opioids (predominantly fentanyl), heroin, and stimulant drugs including methamphetamine and cocaine indicate that males who misuse these drugs are significantly more vulnerable to overdose deaths. These results call for research into diverse biological, behavioral, and social factors that underlie sex differences in human vulnerability to drug overdose.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the current national trends in overdose mortality from opioids (synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, and heroin) and stimulant drugs (psychostimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine) for males and females, over the lifespan (overall range 15-74 years)?

FindingsState-level analyses of data from CDC for 2020-2021 indicate that after controlling for rates of drug misuse, males had significantly greater (2-3 fold) overdose mortality rates than females for synthetic opioids, heroin, psychostimulants and cocaine. These findings were generally consistent across the lifespan, studied as 10-year age bins (especially in the 25-64 age range).

MeaningThese data indicate that males who misuse opioids and stimulant drugs are considerably more vulnerable to overdose mortality, compared to females. This finding calls for research on the underlying biological, behavioral, and social factors."
10.1101/2023.01.19.23284288,Application of Elastic Net Regression for Modeling COVID-19 Sociodemographic Risk Factors,"ObjectivesCOVID-19 has been at the forefront of global concern since its emergence in December of 2019. Determining the social factors that drive case incidence is paramount to mitigating disease spread. We gathered data from the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) along with Democratic voting percentage to attempt to understand which county-level sociodemographic metrics had a significant correlation with case rate for COVID-19.

MethodsWe used elastic net regression due to issues with variable collinearity and model overfitting. Our modelling framework included using the ten Health and Human Services regions as submodels for the two time periods 22 March 2020 to 15 June 2021 (prior to the Delta time period) and 15 June 2021 to 1 November 2021 (the Delta time period).

ResultsStatistically, elastic net improved prediction when compared to multiple regression, as almost every HHS model consistently had a lower root mean square error (RMSE) and satisfactory R2 coefficients. These analyses show that the percentage of minorities, disabled individuals, individuals living in group quarters, and individuals who voted Democratic correlated significantly with COVID-19 attack rate as determined by Variable Importance Plots (VIPs).

ConclusionsThe percentage of minorities per county correlated positively with cases in the earlier time period and negatively in the later time period, which complements previous research. In contrast, higher percentages of disabled individuals per county correlated negatively in the earlier time period. Counties with an above average percentage of group quarters experienced a high attack rate early which then diminished in significance after the primary vaccine rollout. Higher Democratic voting consistently correlated negatively with cases, coinciding with previous findings regarding a partisan divide in COVID-19 cases at the county level. Our findings can assist policymakers in distributing resources to more vulnerable counties in future pandemics based on SVI."

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted predominantly in populations of European ancestry have identified >2,000 BP-associated loci, but other ancestries have been less well-studied. We conducted GWAS of systolic, diastolic, pulse, and mean arterial BP in 100,453 Chinese adults. We identified 128 non-overlapping loci associated with one or more BP traits, harbouring 81 novel associations. Despite strong genetic correlations between populations, we identified appreciably higher heritability and larger variant effect sizes in Chinese compared with European or Japanese ancestry populations. Using instruments derived from these GWAS, multivariable Mendelian randomisation demonstrated strong causal associations of specific BP traits with CVD, including systolic BP with intracranial haemorrhage, and pulse pressure with carotid plaque. The findings reinforce the need for studies in diverse populations to understand the genetic determinants of BP traits and their role in disease risk."
10.1101/2023.01.19.23284811,"A cross-sectional study on knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) and risk factors for dengue seropositivity among children in Fortaleza, Brazil.","BackgroundDengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is associated with four serotypes of the dengue virus. Children are vulnerable to infection with the dengue virus and the risk of severe dengue disease is the highest among infants and children, particularly those who have been previously infected with a different dengue serotype. Sufficient knowledge, positive attitudes, and proper practices (KAP) are essential for dengue prevention and control. This study aims to estimate the dengue seropositivity for study participants and to examine the association between households dengue-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP), and childrens risk of dengue seropositivity, while accounting for socioeconomic and demographic differences in Brazil.

Methodology/Principal FindingsThis analysis was based on a cross-sectional study from Fortaleza, Brazil between November 2019, and February 2020. There were 392 households and 483 participant children who provided a sample of sufficient quality for serological analysis. The main exposure was a households dengue-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices, assessed through a questionnaire to construct a composite KAP score categorized into three levels: low, moderate and high. The main outcome is dengue immunoglobulin G(IgG) antibodies, collected using dried blood spots and assessed with Panbio Dengue IgG indirect ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) test commercial kits.

The estimated crude dengue seroprevalence among participating children (n=483) was 25.1%. 5% (n=20) of households achieved a score of over 75% for KAP, while most households achieved between 50% and 75% of the total scores (n=271, 69%), and 101 households scored lower than 50% of the total score (26%). Each KAP domain was significantly and positively associated with the others. We found high household KAP scores were associated with an increased risk of seropositivity (RR: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.09-3.97, p=0.027). Household adult respondents education level of elementary school or higher was negatively associated with childrens relative risk of being seropositive (RR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.49-0.87, p=0.004). The risk of seropositivity in older children (6-12 years old) was over 6 times that of younger children (2-5 years old) (RR: 6.15, 95% CI: 3.51-10.76, p<0.001). Children living in households with sealed water tanks or no water storage had a lower relative risk of being seropositive (RR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55-0.99, p=0.041).

Conclusions/SignificanceOur results provide insight into the prevalence of dengue seropositivity in Fortaleza, Brazil in children, and certain demographic and socioeconomic characteristics associated with childrens risk of being seropositive. They also suggest that KAP may not identify those more at risk for dengue, although understanding and enhancing households KAP is crucial for effective community dengue control and prevention initiatives.

Author summaryDengue fever has become an increasing threat to public health, with its global expansion and increased presence in dengue endemic countries. This study provides insight into the prevalence of dengue seropositivity in children in Fortaleza, Brazil, a city which has been a hotspot for arbovirus infections. We estimated seroprevalence for certain study population characteristics and identified characteristics that were associated with an increased risk of dengue seropositivity. We also explored the associations of a composite measure of knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) with seropositivity and found an inverse relationship between KAP for dengue control and childrens seropositivity. KAP could change due to previous infection experience, which is a potential limitation of using KAP as a potential predictor of dengue seropositivity in cross-sectional studies. Despite this, KAP remains useful for identifying gaps in knowledge, attitude, and practice that can be used to inform public health measures, such as education campaigns. Measures of social acceptability of interventions should also be considered for inclusion in similar studies, as it would provide an indication of likelihood of adoption of interventions, which provides additional insight for different dengue interventions."
10.1101/2022.09.16.22279985,Bayesian Prediction of Severe Outcomes in the LabMarCS: Laboratory Markers of COVID-19 Severity - Bristol Cohort,"We describe several regression models to predict severe outcomes in COVID-19 and challenges present in complex observational medical data. We demonstrate best practices for data curation, cross-validated statistical modelling, and variable selection emphasizing recent Bayesian methods. The study follows a retrospective observational cohort design using multicentre records across National Health Service (NHS) trusts in southwest England, UK. Participants included hospitalised adult patients positive for SARS-CoV 2 during March to October 2020, totalling 843 patients (mean age 71, 45% female, 32% died or needed ICU stay), split into training (n=590) and validation groups (n=253). Models were fit to predict severe outcomes (ICU admission or death within 28-days of admission to hospital for COVID-19, or a positive PCR result if already admitted) using demographic data and initial results from 30 biomarker tests collected within 3 days of admission or testing positive if already admitted. Cross-validation results showed standard logistic regression had an internal validation median AUC of 0.74 (95% Interval [0.62,0.83]), and external validation AUC of 0.68 [0.61, 0.71]; a Bayesian logistic regression (with horseshoe prior) internal AUC of 0.79 [0.71, 0.87], and external AUC of 0.70 [0.68, 0.71]. Variable selection performed using Bayesian predictive projection determined a four variable model using Age, Urea, Prothrombin time and Neutrophil-Lymphocyte ratio, with a median internal AUC of 0.79 [0.78, 0.80], and external AUC of 0.67 [0.65, 0.69]. We illustrate best-practices protocol for conventional and Bayesian prediction modelling on complex clinical data and reiterate the predictive value of previously identified biomarkers for COVID-19 severity assessment."

Inconsistent underreporting can undermine effective risk assessment due to high uncertainty in predicted future scenarios. Underreporting rates have been particularly high among children and youth, given that asymptomatic school children were often considered a less vulnerable population. In January 2022, the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) was experiencing an Omicron variant outbreak (BA.1/BA.2 subvariants) and public health officials recommended that all students returning to elementary, junior high, and high schools ([~]59,452 students) complete two rapid antigen tests (RATs) to be performed three days apart. To estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, we asked parents and guardians to report the results of the RATs completed by K-12 students using an online survey, and to specify the students school level and if students with positive RAT results had symptoms. When comparing the survey responses with the number of cases and tests reported by the NL testing system, we found that 1 out of every 4.3 (3.1-5.3) positive households were captured by provincial case count, with 5.1% positivity estimated from the RAT results, and 1.2% positivity reported by the provincial testing system. The survey data indicate that a higher percentage of SARS-CoV-2 cases were found in elementary schools, with 62.9% of positive cases (95% CI: 44.3%, 83.0%) reported from elementary school students, and the remaining 37.1% (95% CI: 22.7%, 52.9%) reported from junior high and high school students. Asymptomatic infections were 59.8% of the positive cases, with no significant difference between asymptomatic rates in elementary schools (60.8%) or in junior high and high schools (58.1%). Given the low survey participation rate (3.5%), our results may suffer from sample selection biases, and should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, our estimate of the underreporting ratio is consistent with ratios calculated from serology data, and our study provides insights into infection prevalence and asymptomatic infections in school children, a currently understudied population.

10.1101/2023.01.14.23284558,Determinants of protection against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 and Delta infections in fully vaccinated outpatients,"ObjectivesWe aimed to evaluate the association between the humoral and cellular immune responses and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with Delta or Omicron BA.1 variants in fully vaccinated outpatients.

MethodsAnti-RBD IgG levels and IFN-{gamma} release were evaluated at PCR-diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in 636 samples from negative and positive patients during Delta and Omicron BA.1 periods.

ResultsMedian levels of anti-RBD IgG in positive patients were significantly lower than in negative patients for both variants (p < 0.05). The risk of Delta infection was inversely correlated with anti-RBD IgG titres (aOR = 0.63, 95% CI [0.41; 0.95], p = 0.03) and it was lower in the hybrid immunity group compared to the homologous vaccination group (aOR = 0.22, 95% CI [0.05; 0.62], p = 0.01). In contrast, neither the vaccination scheme nor anti-RBD IgG titers were associated with the risk of BA.1 infection in multivariable analysis. IFN-{gamma} release post-SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation was not different between samples from patients infected (either with Delta or Omicron BA.1 variant) or not (p = 0.77).

ConclusionsOur results show that high circulating levels of anti-RBD IgG and hybrid immunity were independently associated with a lower risk of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in outpatients with differences according to the infecting variant."

As a collaboration model of the International Hundred K+ Cohorts Consortium (IHCC), we endeavored to develop a globally applicable trans-ethnic PRS for body mass index (BMI) through this relatively new international effort.

MethodsThe PRS model was developed trained and tested at the Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) of The Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) based on a BMI meta-analysis from the GIANT consortium. The validated PRS models were subsequently disseminated to the participating sites. Scores were generated by each site locally on their cohorts and summary statistics returned to CAG for final analysis.

ResultsWe show that in the absence of a well powered trans-ethnic GWAS from which to derive SNPs and effect estimates, trans-ethnic scores can be generated from European ancestry GWAS using Bayesian approaches such as LDpred to adjust the summary statistics using trans-ethnic linkage disequilibrium reference panels. The ported trans-ethnic scores outperform population specific-PRS across all non-European ancestry populations investigated including East Asians and three-way admixed Brazilian cohort.

ConclusionsWidespread use of PRS in the clinic is hampered by a lack of genotyping data in individuals of non-European ancestry for the vast majority of traits. Here we show that for a truly polygenic trait such as BMI adjusting the summary statistics of a well powered European ancestry study using trans-ethnic LD reference results in a score that is predictive across a range of ancestries including East Asians and three-way admixed Brazilians."
10.1101/2023.01.15.23284574,Stochastic Transmission in Epidemiological Models,"Recent empirical evidence suggests that the transmission coefficient in susceptible-exposed-infected-removed-like (SEIR-like) models evolves with time, presenting random patterns, and some stylized facts, such as mean-reversion and jumps. To address such observations we propose the use of jump-diffusion stochastic processes to parameterize the transmission coefficient in an SEIR-like model that accounts for death and time-dependent parameters. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the proposed model proving the existence and uniqueness of solutions as well as studying its asymptotic behavior. We also compare the proposed model with some variations possibly including jumps. The forecast performance of the considered models, using reported COVID-19 infections from New York City, is then tested in different scenarios, including major outbreaks. The proposed jump-diffusion model presented remarkably accurate out-of-sample predictions, even during larger forecasted periods."

It killed an estimated 50-100 million people worldwide. In late 1918, when the severity of the disease was apparent, the Australian Quarantine Service was established. Vessels returning from overseas and inter-state were intercepted, and people were examined for signs of illness and quarantined. Some of these vessels carried the infection throughout their voyage and cases were prevalent by the time the ship arrived at a Quarantine Station. We study four outbreaks that took place on board the Medic, Boonah, Devon, and Manuka in late 1918. These ships had returned from overseas and some of them were carrying troops that served in the First World War. By analysing these outbreaks under a stochastic Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework, we estimate the transmission rates among crew and passengers aboard these ships. Furthermore, we ask whether the removal of infectious, convalescent, and healthy individuals after arriving at a Quarantine Station in Australia was an effective public health response.

Author SummaryThe influenza pandemic of 1918-19 was one of the deadliest pandemics in history. In Australia, when it was apparent that the virus was severe, a quarantine service was established to intercept and quarantine ships that returned from overseas and travelled interstate. In this study, we look at the records of outbreaks on board the Medic, Boonah, Devon, and Manuka. Some of the ships carried surviving troops from the First World War, and infections were prevalent when they arrived at a quarantine station. Infectious, convalescent, and healthy individuals on board were moved to the quarantine station for treatment or isolation. We model the outbreaks on the four ships using stochastic epidemic models and estimate the model parameters within a hierarchical framework. Furthermore, we investigate whether the removal of individuals with various disease states was an effective intervention measure from a public health perspective."

Related to absolute and relative changes of baseline creatinine, different criteria for staging may induce under-or over-diagnosis related to sex. At the largest Swiss provider of inpatient acute health care, a clinic decision support algorithm ensures exact staging of kidney disease (2012 KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline). Coding of the indicator ""Present On Admission"" was introduced at this institution in 2018 to flag post-admission conditions.

ObjectiveWe hypothesized sex differences in health care associated acute kidney injury. Defined indicators and the distribution of stages in acute kidney injury were analysed using the POA flag. Sex differences were reported.

MethodsRetrospective observational study. Routinely collected health data, Insel Group, Berne, Switzerland, 2019 and 2020 (121757 cases) on the patient history and intensive care treatment duration, comorbidity levels, coded diagnoses, age and sex. Software and statistic: program R, version 4.1.1, standard deviation; median, interquartile range; prop.test; standardized mean difference.

ResultsThe reporting of post-admission diagnoses was associated with more interhospital transfers, intensive care stays, scores of severity and treatment intensity, mechanical ventilation, age, number of diagnoses, complexity level of the related cases and mortality. A weaker association could be observed for the female population. However, mortality was higher (stage III acute kidney injury 41.6%).

ConclusionUsing the POA-flag the results reflect the clinical situation of complications and comorbidities evolving unexpectedly. As our results show sex differences, i.e. a lower morbidity of female patients for each stage, but a higher mortality, a deeper evaluation of the implied sex differences in staging of kidney disease should follow.

The general results confirm the necessity of a diagnosis-onset reporting in health statistic."

The extent to which official COVID-19 death tallies have captured the true toll of the pandemic in the United States is unknown. In the current study, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate monthly excess mortality in each county over the first two years of the pandemic and compare these estimates to the number of deaths officially attributed to Covid-19 on death certificates. Overall, we estimated that 268,176 excess deaths were not reported as Covid-19 deaths during the first two years of the Covid-19 pandemic, which represented 23.7% of all excess deaths that occurred. Differences between excess deaths and reported COVID-19 deaths were substantial in both the first and second year of the pandemic. Excess deaths were less likely to be reported as COVID-19 deaths in the Mountain division, in the South, and in nonmetro counties. The number of excess deaths exceeded COVID-19 deaths in all Census divisions except for the New England and Middle Atlantic divisions where there were more COVID-19 deaths than excess deaths in large metro areas and medium or small metro areas. Increases in excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 followed similar patterns over time to increases in reported COVID-19 deaths and typically preceded or occurred concurrently with increases in reported COVID-19 deaths. Estimates from this study can be used to inform targeting of resources to areas in which the true toll of the COVID-19 pandemic has been underestimated."

Although the ""One Health"" dimension of resistance is well recognized, data are lacking on the circulation of resistance, particularly in low-income countries. The World Health Organization has proposed a protocol called Tricycle, focusing on extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-Escherichia coli surveillance in the three sectors. We implemented Tricycle in Madagascar to assess ESBL-E. coli prevalence and describe intra- and inter-sector circulation of ESBL-E. coli and plasmids.

Methods289 pregnant women, 246 farm chickens and 28 surface waters were sampled in Antananarivo (the capital city) area and tested for ESBL-E. coli. Isolates were sequenced by short-(Illumina) and long-(Nanopore) read methods.

FindingsESBL-E. coli prevalence was 29{middle dot}8%, 56{middle dot}9% and 100% in pregnant women, chickens, and the environment, respectively. The wet season was associated with higher rates of carriage in humans (OR=3{middle dot}1, 95%CI 1{middle dot}8-5{middle dot}3) and animals (OR=2{middle dot}8 95%CI 1{middle dot}7-4{middle dot}8). Sequencing of 277 non-duplicated isolates (82, 118 and 77 from each sector, respectively) showed high genetic diversity (90 STs identified) with differences between sectors. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis revealed 169/277 (61%) isolates grouped into 44 clusters ([&ge;]2 isolates) of closely related isolates (<40 SNPs), of which 24 contained isolates from two sectors and five contained isolates from all three sectors. ESBL genes were all blaCTX-M (77.6% blaCTX-M-15), chromosomally integrated in 57{middle dot}4% (159/277) of isolates, and plasmidic in 40{middle dot}8% (113/277). The 114 ESBL-carrying plasmids were mainly IncF (55{middle dot}2%, n=63) and IncY (36{middle dot}8%, n=42). The F31/36:A4:B1 (n=13) and F-:A-:B53 (n=8) subtypes, and all IncY plasmids, highly conserved, were observed in isolates of differing genetic backgrounds from all sectors.

InterpretationDespite varying strain population structures in the three sectors, both ESBL-E. coli strains and plasmids are circulating among humans, chickens and the environment in the capital of Madagascar.

Few studies examined the role of omega-6/omega-3 ratio in mortality.

MethodsWe investigated plasma omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs and their ratio in relation to all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a large prospective cohort, the UK Biobank. Of 85,425 participants who had complete information on circulating PUFAs, 6,461 died during follow-up, including 2,794 from cancer and 1,668 from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Associations were estimated by multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustment for relevant risk factors.

ResultsRisk for all three mortality outcomes increased as the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 PUFAs increased (all Ptrend < 0.05). Comparing the highest to the lowest quintiles, individuals had 26% (95% CI, 15-38%) higher total mortality, 14% (95% CI, 0-31%) higher cancer mortality, and 31% (95% CI, 10-55%) higher CVD mortality. Moreover, omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs in plasma were all inversely associated with all-cause, cancer, and CVD mortality, with omega-3 showing stronger effects.

ConclusionsUsing a population-based cohort in UK Biobank, our study revealed a strong association between the ratio of circulating omega-6/omega-3 PUFAs and the risk of all-cause, cancer, and CVD mortality."
10.1101/2023.01.18.23284671,"Investigating associations of omega-3 fatty acids, lung function decline, and airway obstruction","RationaleInflammation contributes to lung function decline and the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and may benefit lung health.

ObjectivesInvestigate associations of omega-3 fatty acids with lung function decline and incident airway obstruction in adults of diverse races/ethnicities from general population cohorts.

MethodsComplementary study designs: (1) longitudinal study of plasma phospholipid omega-3 fatty acids and repeated FEV1 and FVC measures in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Pooled Cohorts Study, and (2) two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) study of genetically predicted omega-3 fatty acids and lung function parameters.

Measurements and Main ResultsThe longitudinal study found that higher omega-3 fatty acid concentrations were associated with attenuated lung function decline in 15,063 participants, with the largest effect sizes for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). One standard deviation higher DHA was associated with an attenuation of 1.8 mL/year for FEV1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-2.2) and 2.4 mL/year for FVC (95% CI 1.9-3.0). One standard deviation higher DHA was also associated with a 9% lower incidence of spirometry-defined airway obstruction (95% CI 0.86-0.97). DHA associations persisted across sexes, smoking histories, and Black, white and Hispanic participants, with the largest magnitude associations in former smokers and Hispanics. The MR study showed positive associations of genetically predicted omega-3 fatty acids with FEV1 and FVC, with statistically significant findings across multiple MR methods.

ConclusionsThe longitudinal and MR studies provide evidence supporting beneficial effects of higher circulating omega-3 fatty acids, especially DHA, on lung health."

Previous research demonstrated that suicide deaths actually decreased in 2020 in the US. An update covering 2021-2022 with regional data is warranted.

MethodsObservational cohort, US and regional data. Expected monthly deaths were modeled using pre-pandemic US and regional data (2015-2020). Mortality data was accessed from CDC public reporting.

ResultsWe find that suicide deaths in the United States were below expected levels throughout the pandemic period (March 1, 2020-June 30,2022) with >4,100 fewer suicide deaths than would have been expected to occur during the study period. Stratifying suicide mortality by US Census Bureau region yielded statistically significant decreases from expected suicide deaths in all regions except the Midwest, (which recorded no significant change in suicide deaths during the overall pandemic period).

ConclusionSuicide mortality is down in the US since the pandemic began, through June 30, 2022. Possible explanations include an early ""coming together"" effect; Later, increased access to mental health resources and a greater focus on mental health in the media may have reduced stigma and barriers in seeking necessary psychiatric care."

In order to combat the pandemic, the Ministry of Health has established a number of standard operating procedures (SOP) and started operating COVID-19 Assessment Centers (CAC). This study compares the expert system created using the current patient evaluation standards to the capabilities of machine learning approaches in capturing the potential of being admitted directly or during home quarantine, based on the different clinical symptoms and age group. Boruta is a feature selection method that is employed to rank and extract significant characteristics.

Treatment for imbalance has been carried out by under-sampling with K-Means and over-sampling with SMOTE. It appeared that the machine learning method using Random Forest would perform better than the expert systems. There are five performance metrics used in this study, i.e. accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and specificity. This study focused to maximize the true positive rate while minimize the false negative rates, it is to make sure that the patient who really need to be hospitalized will not be missed out. Therefore, recall becomes the main evaluation metrics when comparing the machine learning model and the expert system. The results shown that the recall score for machine learning approach is vastly higher then of expert systems. For age group 18-59, machine learning has 32.75% recall more than the expert system to predict if a patient requires direct admission, while for age group more than 60, the recall of machine learning is 18.11% more than expert system. In addition, to predict if a patient require admission during their home quarantine due to their health deterioration, machine learning recorded 76.72% recall more than the expert system for patient aged 18 to 59, and 70.59% difference for patient more than 60 years old. This supports the potential application of machine learning for clinical decision making for COVID-19 patients."

A Brazil - UK collaborative study.,"We had developed a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry method for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in saliva-gargle samples using Shimadzu MALDI-TOF mass spectrometers in the UK. This was validated in the USA to CLIA-LDT standards for asymptomatic infection detection remotely via sharing protocols, shipping key reagents, video conference and data exchange. In Brazil, more so than in the UK and USA, there is a need to develop non-PCR dependent rapid affordable SARS-CoV-2 infection screening tests, which also identify variant SARS-CoV-2 and other virus infections. Travel restrictions necessitated remote collaboration with validation on the available Clinical MALDI-TOF - the Bruker Biotyper (microflex(R) LT/SH) - and on nasopharyngeal swab samples, as salivary gargle samples were not available. The Bruker Biotyper was shown to be almost log10^3 more sensitive at detection of high molecular weight spike proteins. A protocol for saline swab soaks out was developed and duplicate swab samples collected in Brazil were analysed by MALDI-TOF MS. The swab collected sample spectra varied from that of gargle-saliva in three additional mass peaks in the mass region expected for IgG heavy chains and human serum albumin. A subset of clinical samples with additional high mass, probably Spike-related proteins, were also found. Spectral data comparisons and analysis, subjected to machine learning algorithms in order to resolve RT-qPCR positive from RT-qPCR negative swab samples, showed a 78% agreement with RT-qPCR scoring for SARS-CoV-2 infection."

MethodsDuring SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant circulation between October 2021 and April 2022, prospectively enrolled adult patients with outpatient ARI had respiratory and filter paper blood specimens collected for SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing and serology. Dried blood spots were tested for immunoglobulin-G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (NP) and spike protein receptor binding domain antigen using a validated multiplex bead assay. Evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection also included documented or self-reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We used documented COVID-19 vaccination status to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) by multivariable logistic regression by prior infection status.

Results455 (29%) of 1577 participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at enrollment; 209 (46%) case-patients and 637 (57%) test-negative patients were NP seropositive, had documented previous laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, or self-reported prior infection. Among previously uninfected patients, three-dose VE was 97% (95% confidence interval [CI], 60%- 99%) against Delta, but not statistically significant against Omicron. Among previously infected patients, three-dose VE was 57% (CI, 20%-76%) against Omicron; VE against Delta could not be estimated.

ConclusionsThree mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses provided additional protection against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant-associated illness among previously infected participants."
10.1101/2023.01.09.23284345,MVMRmode: Introducing an R package for plurality valid estimators for multivariable Mendelian randomisation,"BackgroundMendelian randomisation (MR) is the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables. Mode-based estimators (MBE) are one of the most popular types of estimators used in univariable-MR studies. However, because there are no plurality valid regression estimators, there are no existent modal estimators for multivariable-MR.

MethodsWe use the residual method for multivariable-MR to introduce two multivariable modal estimators: multivariable-MBE, which uses IVW to create residuals fed into a traditional plurality valid estimator, and multivariable-CM which instead has the residuals fed into the contamination mixture method. We then use Monte-Carlo simulations to explore the performance of these estimators when compared to existing ones and re-analyse the data used by Grant and Burgess (2021) looking at the causal effect of intelligence, education, and household income on Alzheimers disease as an applied example.

ResultsIn our simulation, we found that multivariable-MBE was generally too variable to be much use. Multivariable-CM produced more precise estimates on the other hand. Multivariable-CM performed better than MR-Egger in almost all settings, and Weighted Median under balanced pleiotropy. However, it underperformed Weighted Median when there was a moderate amount of directional pleiotropy. Our re-analysis supported the conclusion of Grant and Burgess (2021), that intelligence had a protective effect on Alzheimers disease, while education, and household income do not have a causal effect.

ConclusionsHere we introduced two, non-regression-based, plurality valid estimators for multivariable MR. Of these, ""multivariable-CM"" which uses IVW to create residuals fed into a contamination-mixture model, performed the best. This method uses a plurality of variants valid assumption, and appears to provided precise and unbiased estimates in the presence of balanced pleiotropy and small amounts of directional pleiotropy. We developed the MVMRmode R package (available from https://github.com/bar-woolf/MVMRmode/wiki) to facilitate the use of this estimator. We hope this will further enable the future triangulation of univariable MR studies which have used plurality valid estimators with multivariable MR designs."

Inclusion of other variables may improve risk prediction.

ObjectiveIdentify variables improving CVD risk prediction beyond recalibrated PCE.

DesignProspective cohort study; sex-stratified Cox survival models with LASSO stability selection to predict CVD in non-overlapping subsets: variable selection (40%), model training (30%) and testing (30%).

SettingUK population.

ParticipantsUK Biobank: 121,724 and 182,632 healthy men and women, respectively, aged 38-73 years at baseline.

MeasurementsPersonal/family medical history; lifestyle factors; genetic, biochemical, hematological, and metabolomic blood markers. Outcomes were incident hospitalization or mortality from CVD.

ResultsThere were 11,899 (men) and 9,110 (women) incident CVD cases with median 12.1 years follow-up. Variables selected for both men and women were: age, albumin, antihypertensive medication, apolipoprotein B, atrial fibrillation, C-reactive protein, current smoker, cystatin C, family history of coronary artery disease, glycated hemoglobin, polygenic risk score (PRS) for CVD and systolic blood pressure. Also selected: apolipoprotein A1, lipoprotein(a), white blood cell count, deprivation index (men); triglycerides (women). C-statistics for recalibrated PCE were 0.67 [0.66-0.68] and 0.69 [0.68-0.70] in men and women, respectively, improving to 0.71 [0.70-0.72] and 0.72 [0.71-0.73] with LASSO stably selected variables. Categorical net reclassification improvement (7.5% risk threshold) versus PCE was 0.054 [0.038-0.070] (men) and 0.081 [0.063-0.099] (women). Addition of targeted metabolomic data to LASSO stability selection did not improve predictive accuracy.

10.1101/2023.01.09.23284348,Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene (IL1RN) variants modulate the cytokine release syndrome and mortality of SARS-CoV-2,"ObjectiveTo explore the regulation of the inflammatory response in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, we examined effects of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of IL1RN, the gene encoding the anti-inflammatory IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), on the cytokine release syndrome and mortality.

MethodsWe studied 2589 patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 between March 2020 and March 2021 at NYU Langones Tisch Hospital. CTA and TTG haplotypes formed from three SNVs (rs419598, rs315952, rs9005) and the individual SNVs of the IL1RN gene were assessed for association with laboratory markers of the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and mortality.

ResultsMortality in the population was 15.3%, and was lower in women than men (13.1% vs.17.3%, p<0.0003). Carriers of the CTA-1/2 IL1RN haplotypes exhibited decreased inflammatory markers and increased plasma IL-1Ra relative to TTG carriers. Decreased mortality among CTA-1/2 carriers was observed in male patients between the ages of 55-74 [9.2% vs. 17.9%, p=0.001]. Evaluation of individual SNVs of the IL1RN gene (rs419598, rs315952, rs9005) indicated that carriers of the IL1RN rs419598 CC SNV exhibited lower inflammatory biomarker levels, and was associated with reduced mortality compared to the CT/TT genotype in men (OR 0.49 (0.23 - 1.00); 0.052), with the most pronounced effect observed between the ages of 55-74 [5.5% vs. 18.4%, p<0.001].

ConclusionThe IL1RN haplotype CTA, and sequence variant of rs419598 are associated with attenuation of the cytokine release syndrome and decreased mortality in males with acute SARS-CoV2 infection. The data suggest that IL1RN modulates the COVID-19 cytokine release syndrome via endogenous "" anti-inflammatory"" mechanisms.

Significance statementWe provide evidence that variants of IL1RN modulate the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The IL1RN CTA haplotype and rs419598 CC single nucleotide variant are associated with decreased plasma levels of inflammatory markers, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1{beta}), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-2 (IL-2), C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, ferritin, and procalcitonin, in association with higher levels of IL-1Ra and IL-10, anti-inflammatory proteins. Both haplotype CTA and rs419598 CC genotype are associated with a significant reduction in the mortality of men. These data provide genetic evidence that inflammasome activation and the IL-1 pathway plays an important role in the mortality and morbidity associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that genetic regulation of inflammatory pathways by variants of IL1RN merits further evaluation in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection."
10.1101/2023.01.11.23284425,How often is the core outcome set for low back pain used in clinical trials? A protocol for a meta-epidemiological study,"BackgroundNon-specific Low back pain (NSLBP) is the worldwide leading cause of disability, accounting for large costs for healthcare systems and work productivity. Many treatment options are available for patients with NSLBP. Authors of systematic reviews on LBP report that outcomes are often measured and reported inconsistently. This inconsistency limits the comparison of findings among trials, and it can be due to selective outcome reporting bias (e.g. reporting only outcomes with positive results in a publication), which strongly affects the conclusions of systematic reviews. Recommendations for standardised reporting of outcome measurement instruments in clinical studies were initially publicated in 1998 and updated through an international consensus Delphi study by Chiarotto and colleagues in 2015. This updated Core Outcome Set (COS) for NSLBP included the following core outcome domains: ""physical functioning"", ""pain intensity"", ""health-related quality of life"", and ""number of deaths"". With the exception of ""number of deaths"", the other three core domains were already included in the core set publicated in 1998 by Deyo et al. In 2018, another international consensus of Chiarotto et al. formulated recommendations on which core outcome measurement instruments (Core Outcome Measurement Set - COMS) should be used in NSLBP trials. A consensus was reached on Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for ""pain intensity"", Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) or Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ-24) for ""physical functioning"", Short Form Health Survey 12 (SF12) or 10-item PROMIS Global Health (PROMIS-GH-10) for ""HRQOL"". Therefore, the recommended COS has been in the public domain for more than 20 years. However, it is still unknown whether it has changed the selection of outcomes used in NSLBP trials during this period.

Objectives(1)To assess the uptake of the COS for NSLBP in clinical trials; (2)To assess the uptake of the Core Outcome Measurement Set for NSLBP in clinical trials; (3)To analyse whether specific study characteristics (year of registration, sample size, country of origin, duration of follow-up, phase of the trial, intervention, and source of funding) are associated with the COS uptake

MethodsWe will adopt Kirkham et al.s recommendations on the assessment of COS uptake. We will search the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and Clinicaltrials.gov registry to identify potentially eligible trial protocols. Two reviewers (TI and SG) will select potentially eligible entries and evaluate whether they meet the eligibility criteria. A consensus meeting will be held to determine agreement on the selection; in case of disagreement, a third reviewer (SS) will decide on inclusion. We will calculate the percentage of clinical trials that planned to measure data on the NSLBP full COS. We will also calculate the proportion of trials that reported the percentage of trials measuring the full COS per year. We will calculate the percentage of the NSLBP core outcome measurement instruments used per each domain described in the COS. Lastly, we will perform a multivariable logistic regression analysis to assess the relationship between the full COS uptake (yes/no) as the dependent variable and the following independent variables: year of registration, sample size, country of origin, duration of follow-up interval, phase of the trial (III or IV), intervention (pharmacological trial vs non-pharmacological trial), and source of funding (commercial vs non-commercial vs no funding).

Ethics and disseminationA manuscript will be prepared and submitted for publication in an appropriate peer-reviewed journal upon study completion. We believe that the results of this investigation will be relevant to researchers paying more attention to the synthesis of the evidence to translate clinical implications to key stakeholders (healthcare providers and patients)."

We assessed the actual population uptake of mammography and cervical screening during this period.

MethodsThe first COVID-19 lockdown in Denmark was announced on 11 March 2020. To investigate possible changes in cancer screening activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we analysed data from the beginning of 2017 until the end of 2021, searching for trends and outliers in the activity throughout this period, particularly after the first lockdown. Data on mammography screening and cervical screening were retrieved from governmental pandemic-specific monitoring of health care activities.

ResultsA brief drop was seen in screening activity right after the first COVID-19 lockdown, but the activity quickly returned to its previous level. A short-term deficit of 43% [-49 to -37] was found for mammography screening. A short-term deficit of 62% [-65 to -58] was found for cervical screening. Furthermore, a slight, statistically significant downward trend in cervical screening from 2018 to 2021 was probably unrelated to the pandemic. Other changes, e.g. a marked drop in mammography screening towards the end of 2021, also seem unrelated to the pandemic.

ConclusionsThe policy in Denmark of continuing cancer screening during the pandemic was implemented very effectively."

DesignA mixed-method study.

SettingThe study was carried out at Raute temporary campsites in the Surkhet District of Karnali Province between May to September 2021.

ParticipantsThe questionnaire-based survey included all males and non-pregnant females of the nomadic Raute group aged 15 years and above. In-depth interviews were conducted among purposively selected 15 Raute participants and four non-Raute key informants to help explain and enrich the quantitative findings.

Outcome measuresThe prevalence of hypertension (defined as brachial artery blood pressure of systolic [&ge;]140 mm Hg and/or diastolic [&ge;]90 mm Hg) and its socio-demographic, anthropometric, and behavioral covariates.

ResultsOf the 85 eligible participants, 81 [median age 35 years (interquartile range: 26-51), 46.9% female] were included in the final analysis. Hypertension was found in 10.5% of females, 48.8% of men, and 30.9% of the total population. Current alcohol and tobacco use were high (91.4% and 70.4%, respectively), with concerning high rates among youths. Males, older people, current drinkers, and current tobacco users were more likely to have hypertension. Our qualitative analysis suggests that the traditional forest-based Raute economy is gradually transitioning into a cash-based one that heavily relies on government incentives. Consumption of commercial foods, drinks, and tobacco products is increasing as their market involvement grows.

ConclusionThis study found a high burden of hypertension, alcohol, and tobacco use among nomadic Raute hunter-gatherers facing socioeconomic and dietary transitions. Further research is needed to assess the long-term impact of these changes on their health. This study is expected to help appraise concerned policymakers of an emerging health concern and formulate context-specific and culturally sensitive interventions to limit hypertension-related morbidities and mortalities in this endangered population.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThis is the first study to report the prevalence of hypertension and its covariates among the nomadic Raute hunter-gatherers of Nepal.
C_LIO_LIThe major strengths of this study are the use of a mixed-method design to have both quantitative and qualitative perspectives, near total population enrollment, and robust methodology.

10.1101/2022.11.14.22281814,Monitoring Body Composition Change for Intervention Studies with Advancing 3D Optical Imaging Technology in Comparison to Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry,"BackgroundRecent three-dimensional optical (3DO) imaging advancements have provided more accessible, affordable, and self-operating opportunities for assessing body composition. 3DO is accurate and precise with respect to clinical measures made by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, the sensitivity for monitoring body composition change over time with 3DO body shape is unknown.

ObjectiveTo evaluate 3DOs ability to monitor body composition changes across multiple intervention studies.

MethodsA retrospective analysis was performed using intervention studies on healthy adults that were complimentary to the cross-sectional study, Shape Up! Adults. Each participant received a DXA (Hologic Discovery/A system) and 3DO (Fit3D ProScanner) scan at baseline and follow-up. 3DO meshes were digitally registered and reposed using Meshcapade to standardize the vertices and pose. Using an established statistical shape model, each 3DO mesh was transformed into principal components (PCs), which were used to predict whole-body and regional body composition values using published equations. Body composition changes (follow-up minus baseline) were compared to DXA with linear regression.

ResultsThe analysis included 133 participants (45 females) in six studies. The mean (SD) length of follow-up was 13 (5) weeks, range 3-23 weeks. Agreement between 3DO and DXA (R2) for changes in total fat mass (FM), total fat-free mass (FFM), and appendicular lean mass, respectively, were 0.86, 0.73, and 0.70 with RMSEs of 1.98 kg, 1.58 kg, and 0.37 kg in females, and 0.75, 0.75, and 0.52 with RMSEs of 2.31 kg, 1.77 kg, and 0.52 kg in males. Further adjustment with demographic descriptors improved the 3DO change agreement to changes observed with DXA.

ConclusionsAs compared to DXA, 3DO was highly sensitive in detecting body shape changes over time. The 3DO method was sensitive enough to detect even small changes in body composition during intervention studies. The safety and accessibility of 3DO allows users to self-monitor on a frequent basis throughout interventions."

Prevalence of GDM varies between ethnicities, with South Asians (SAs) experiencing up to three times the risk compared to white Europeans (WEs). This study aimed to evaluate the causal role of metabolic characteristics in the ethnic-associated differences in gestational dysglycemia.

A one-sample Mendelian Randomisation (MR) was performed separately on 3688 SA and 3354 WE women (<28th week of pregnancy) from the Born in Bradford (BiB) cohort for 146 metabolites exposures for the outcomes of fasting glucose and 2-hr post glucose (P [&le;] 1 x 10-5 was considered significant). Additional GWAS and MR analyses on 22 composite measures of metabolite classes were also conducted.

Through an extensive GWAS analysis this study identified 15 novel genome-wide significant (GWS) SNPs associated with tyrosine in the FOXN and SLC13A2 genes and 1 novel GWS SNP (currently in no known gene) associated with acetate in SAs. Through the utilisation of a MR analysis, 14 metabolites were found to be associated with postprandial glucose in WEs, while in SAs a distinct panel of 11 metabolites were identified. Furthermore, in WEs, cholesterols were most the common metabolite associated with dysglycemia, while in SAs saturated fatty acids were most common. Furthermore, in SAs a composite measure of the fatty acid class was also found to associate with 2-hour post glucose.

The presence of ethnic-specific causal relationships between a comprehensive set of metabolites and postprandial glucose measures (fasting glucose and 2-hour post glucose) in mid-pregnancy has been established in a UK SA and WE population. Future work should aim to investigate the biological mechanisms of metabolites on GDM risk and inform ethnically tailored GDM prevention strategies are required."
10.1101/2023.01.15.23284579,Extensive SARS-CoV-2 testing reveals BA.1/BA.2 asymptomatic rates and underreporting in school children,"Case underreporting during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a major challenge to the planning and evaluation of public health responses. Inconsistent underreporting can undermine effective risk assessment due to high uncertainty in predicted future scenarios. Underreporting rates have been particularly high among children and youth, given that asymptomatic school children were often considered a less vulnerable population. In January 2022, the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) was experiencing an Omicron variant outbreak (BA.1/BA.2 subvariants) and public health officials recommended that all students returning to elementary, junior high, and high schools ([~]59,452 students) complete two rapid antigen tests (RATs) to be performed three days apart. To estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, we asked parents and guardians to report the results of the RATs completed by K-12 students using an online survey, and to specify the students school level and if students with positive RAT results had symptoms. When comparing the survey responses with the number of cases and tests reported by the NL testing system, we found that 1 out of every 4.3 (3.1-5.3) positive households were captured by provincial case count, with 5.1% positivity estimated from the RAT results, and 1.2% positivity reported by the provincial testing system. The survey data indicate that a higher percentage of SARS-CoV-2 cases were found in elementary schools, with 62.9% of positive cases (95% CI: 44.3%, 83.0%) reported from elementary school students, and the remaining 37.1% (95% CI: 22.7%, 52.9%) reported from junior high and high school students. Asymptomatic infections were 59.8% of the positive cases, with no significant difference between asymptomatic rates in elementary schools (60.8%) or in junior high and high schools (58.1%). Given the low survey participation rate (3.5%), our results may suffer from sample selection biases, and should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, our estimate of the underreporting ratio is consistent with ratios calculated from serology data, and our study provides insights into infection prevalence and asymptomatic infections in school children, a currently understudied population.

10.1101/2023.01.29.23285158,Modeling the HIV epidemic in MSM in Cyprus: Reaching only the 95-95-95 cascade of care targets fails to reduce HIV incidence by 90% in 2030,"ObjectivesNational responses should be improved and accelerated to meet the target of ending the Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic by 2030. In the Republic of Cyprus, Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), accounting approximately for half of all annual HIV diagnoses. This study aims to assess the evolution of HIV incidence in MSM in Cyprus until 2030 under different scenarios.

MethodsA model of HIV transmission and progression was calibrated to Cypriot epidemiological data. Four scenarios were examined: status quo, two scenarios focusing on introducing Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), and a 90% HIV incidence reduction scenario.

ResultsReaching only the 95-95-95 HIV cascade of care (CoC) targets among MSM fails to achieve the 90% reduction in HIV incidence: the estimated reduction in 2030 compared to 2015 would be 48.6%. Initiating a PrEP intervention only for high risk MSM would cause a modest further reduction in HIV incidence. To meet the 90% HIV reduction target, PrEP should be expanded to both high and medium risk MSM and, after 2025, behavioral interventions should be implemented so as high risk MSM gradually move to the medium risk category.

ConclusionsCyprus will not reach the HIV incidence reduction target by 2030 unless PrEP is gradually promoted and delivered to all high and medium risk MSM along with awareness and behavioral interventions."

However, the population prevalence of persistent infections, their viral load kinetics, and evolutionary dynamics over the course of infections remain largely unknown. We identified 381 infections lasting at least 30 days, of which 54 lasted at least 60 days. These persistently infected individuals had more than 50% higher odds of self-reporting Long Covid compared to the infected controls, and we estimate that 0.09-0.5% of SARS-CoV-2 infections can become persistent and last for at least 60 days. In nearly 70% of the persistent infections we identified, there were long periods during which there were no consensus changes in virus sequences, consistent with prolonged presence of non-replicating virus. Our findings also suggest reinfections with the same major lineage are rare and that many persistent infections are characterised by relapsing viral load dynamics. Furthermore, we found a strong signal for positive selection during persistent infections, with multiple amino acid substitutions in the Spike and ORF1ab genes emerging independently in different individuals, including mutations that are lineage-defining for SARS-CoV-2 variants, at target sites for several monoclonal antibodies, and commonly found in immunocompromised patients 11-14. This work has significant implications for understanding and characterising SARS-CoV-2 infection, epidemiology, and evolution."
10.1101/2022.07.26.22278052,"Geographic and temporal trends in fentanyl-detected deaths in Connecticut, 2009-2019","PurposeSince 2012 fentanyl-detected fatal overdoses have risen from 4% of all fatal overdoses in Connecticut to 82% in 2019. We aimed to investigate the geographic and temporal trends in fentanyl-detected deaths in Connecticut during 2009-2019.

MethodsData on the dates and locations of accidental/undetermined opioid-detected fatalities were obtained from Connecticut Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Using a Bayesian space-time binomial model, we estimated spatiotemporal trends in the proportion of fentanyl-detected deaths.

ResultsDuring 2009-2019, a total of 6,632 opioid deaths were identified. Among these, 3,234 (49%) were fentanyl-detected. The modeled spatial patterns suggested that opioid deaths in northeastern Connecticut had higher probability of being fentanyl-detected, while New Haven and its neighboring towns and the southwestern region of Connecticut, primarily Greenwich, had a lower risk. Model estimates also suggested fentanyl-detected deaths gradually overtook the preceding non-fentanyl opioid-detected deaths across Connecticut. The estimated temporal trend showed the probability of fentanyl involvement increased substantially since 2014.

ConclusionOur findings suggest that geographic variation exists in the probability of fentanyl-detected deaths, and areas at heightened risk are identified. Further studies are warranted to explore potential factors contributing to the geographic heterogeneity and continuing dispersion of fentanyl-detected deaths in Connecticut."

This study aimed to elucidate the recovery of cancer care from the COVID-19 pandemic in Ehime Prefecture, Japan.

MethodsThis study collected data from the hospital-based cancer registry (HBCR) as well as the number of outpatients, medical information provision fee payments (MIP2), and second opinion patients (SOP) from the Council of Ehime Cancer Care Hospitals (ECCH). Then cancer care and patient requests for hospital transfers before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed.

ResultThe HBCR from the ECCH comprises >80% of cancer cases in Ehime Prefecture. In 2020, the numbers of all registered cases, first-line treatment cases, and cases detected by cancer screening in the HBCR decreased from those in 2018-2019. In 2021, they increased to almost the same levels as those in 2020. In contrast, the number of registered patients that changed hospitals (hospital-change cases) after first-line treatments, patients who lived outside the metropolitan area of Ehime but registered in metropolitan hospitals, MIP2, and SOP remained low in 2021 after decreasing in 2020. Furthermore, using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, the monthly numbers of hospital-change cases, MIP2, and SOP were significantly smaller in 2021 than in 2018-2019.

ConclusionThe assessed indicators suggest that the willingness of cancer patients to improve and/or advance cancer care had not returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2021. Hence, psychological measures in society and support for patient caregivers are necessary to prevent self-restraint in patients receiving cancer care.

Mini-abstractThe number of registered cases in hospital-based cancer registries returned to pre-COVID-19 levels by 2021, cancer patients willingness to further their care did not return to pre-pandemic levels."
10.1101/2022.05.31.22275755,The global prevalence and ethnic heterogeneity of iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia,"BackgroundIron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia (IRIDA) is an autosomal recessive iron deficiency anaemia caused by mutations in the TMPRSS6 gene. Iron deficiency anaemia is common, whereas IRIDA is rare. The prevalence of IRIDA is unclear. This study aimed to estimate the carrier frequency and genetic prevalence of IRIDA using Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) data.

MethodsThe pathogenicity of TMPRSS6 variants was interpreted according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) standards and guidelines. The minor allele frequency (MAF) of TMPRSS6 gene disease-causing variants in 141456 unique individuals was examined to estimate the global prevalence of IRIDA in seven ethnicities: African/African American (afr), American Admixed/Latino (amr), Ashkenazi Jewish (asj), East Asian (eas), Finnish (fin), Non-Finnish European (nfe) and South Asian (sas). The global and population-specific carrier frequencies and genetic prevalence of IRIDA were calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg equation.

ResultsIn total, 86 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (PV/LPV) were identified according to ACMG/AMP guideline. The global carrier frequency and genetic prevalence of IRIDA were 2.02 per thousand and 1.02 per million, respectively.

ConclusionsThe prevalence of IRIDA is greater than previous estimates."

Diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation carried out mostly via antigen or microscopy-based techniques. However, these methods are increasingly being superseded by molecular techniques for diagnostics. Here we investigate the level of protozoa coinfection identified by molecular methods in Campylobacter positive samples missed through use of antigen-based assays and then investigated different molecular testing protocols.

MethodsWe report the findings of two observational studies; the first among 111 people with diarrhoea during a large Campylobacter outbreak in Havelock North, and the second a study during normal surveillance activities among 158 people presenting with diarrhoea and a positive Campylobacter test, but negative Cryptosporidium and/or Giardia antigen-based diagnostic test result. The molecular methods used for comparison with the antigen-based tests were in-house end-point PCR tests targeting the gp60 gene for Cryptosporidium and gdh gene for Giardia. DNA extraction was performed with and without bead-beating and comparisons with commercial real-time quantitative (qPCR) were made using clinical samples diluted down to 10-5 for Cryptosporidium positive samples.

ResultsThe coinfection prevalence was 9% (n= 10, 3-15% 95%CI) for Cryptosporidium and 21% (n=23, 12- 29% 95%CI) for Giardia in the 111 Campylobacter patients of the Havelock North outbreak. The coinfection prevalence was 40% (n=62, 32-48% 95%CI) for Cryptosporidium and 1.3% (n=2, 0.2-4.5% 95%CI) for Giardia in the 158 routine surveillance samples. Sequencing identified Cryptosporidium hominis, C. parvum, and Giardia intestinalis assemblages A and B among patients. We found no statistical difference in positive test results between samples using end-point PCR with or without bead-beating prior to DNA extraction, or between the in-house end-point PCR and qPCR. The qPCR Ct value was 36 (35-37 95%CI) for 1 oocyst, suggesting a high limit of detection.

DiscussionIn surveillance and outbreak situations we found diagnostic serology testing substantially underdiagnoses Cryptosporidium and Giardia coinfections in Campylobacter patients. These findings suggest that the impact of protozoa infections may be underestimated, through underdiagnosis, but molecular techniques likely improve detection capabilities. Laboratories need to understand clinical, rather than analytical, test sensitivity, to allow clinicians to better understand the disease aetiologies of patients that enable better health advice."

Understanding real world vaccine effectiveness in the setting of emerging variants is critical. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection among children aged >6 months and adults aged <50 years.

MethodsCASCADIA is a four-year community-based prospective study of SARS-CoV-2 VE among adult and pediatric populations aged 6 months to 49 years in Oregon and Washington. At enrollment and regular intervals, participants complete a sociodemographic questionnaire. Individuals provide a blood sample at enrollment and annually thereafter, with additional, optional blood draws after infection and vaccination. Participants complete weekly self-collection of anterior nasal swabs and symptom questionnaires. Swabs are tested for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens by RT-PCR, with results of selected pathogens returned to participants; nasal swabs with SARS-CoV-2 detected will undergo whole genome sequencing. Participants who report symptoms outside of their weekly swab collection and symptom survey are asked to collect an additional swab. Participants who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 undergo serial swab collection every three days for three weeks. Serum samples are tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibody by binding and neutralization assays.

AnalysisCox regression models will be used to estimate the hazard ratio associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among the pediatric and adult population, controlling for demographic factors and potential confounders, including clustering within households.

Ethics and disseminationAll study materials including the protocol, consent forms, participant communication and recruitment materials, and data collection instruments were approved by the Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW) Institutional Review Board, the IRB of record for the study.

Strengths/LimitationsO_LICASCADIA will include a large sample of children and adults that will contribute to estimation of vaccine effectiveness.

10.1101/2023.01.06.23284264,The interplay between pre-season population susceptibility and the effectiveness of the rolled out vaccination control the timing and size of an emerging seasonal influenza wave in England,"1.Relaxing social distancing measures and reduced level of influenza over the last two seasons may lead to a winter 2022 influenza wave in England. We used an established model for influenza transmission and vaccination to evaluate the rolled out influenza immunisation programme over October to December 2022. Specifically, we explored how the interplay between pre-season population susceptibility and influenza vaccine efficacy control the timing and the size of a possible winter influenza wave. Our findings suggest that susceptibility affects the timing and the height of a potential influenza wave, with higher susceptibility leading to an earlier and larger influenza wave while vaccine efficacy controls the size of the peak of the influenza wave. With pre-season susceptibility higher than pre-COVID-19 levels, under the planned vaccine programme an early influenza epidemic wave is possible, its size dependent on vaccine effectiveness against the circulating strain. If pre-season susceptibility is low and similar to pre-COVID levels, the planned influenza vaccine programme with an effective vaccine could largely suppress a winter 2022 influenza outbreak in England."
10.1101/2023.01.06.22283653,The incidence of COVID-19-related hospitalisation in migrants in the UK: Findings from the Virus Watch prospective community cohort study,"BackgroundMigrants in the UK may be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure; however, little is known about their risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation during waves 1-3 of the pandemic.

MethodsWe analysed secondary care data linked to Virus Watch study data for adults and estimated COVID-19-related hospitalisation incidence rates by migration status. To estimate the total effect of migration status on COVID-19 hospitalisation rates, we ran fixed-effect Poisson regression for wave 1 (01/03/2020-31/08/2020; wildtype), and fixed-effect negative binomial regressions for waves 2 (01/09/2020-31/05/2021; Alpha) and 3 (01/06/2020-31/11/2021; Delta). Results of all models were then meta-analysed.

ResultsOf 30,276 adults in the analyses, 26,492 (87.5%) were UK-born and 3,784 (12.5%) were migrants. COVID-19-related hospitalisation incidence rates for UK-born and migrant individuals across waves 1-3 were 2.7 [95% CI 2.2-3.2], and 4.6 [3.1-6.7] per 1,000 person-years, respectively. Pooled incidence rate ratios across waves suggested increased rate of COVID-19-related hospitalisation in migrants compared to UK-born individuals in unadjusted 1.68 [1.08-2.60] and adjusted analyses 1.35 [0.71-2.60].

ConclusionOur findings suggest migration populations in the UK have excess risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisations and underscore the need for more equitable interventions particularly aimed at COVID-19 vaccination uptake among migrants."

This study evaluated the prevalence of HBV infection among healthcare workers (HCW) in Kisumu County.

MethodsWe determined the prevalence of HBV infections among 192 HCW from nine purposively selected high volume public hospitals in Kisumu County. A structured questionnaire was administered, and 4.0 ml of venous blood sample collected for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) and total hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) testing using enzyme immunoassay (EIA).

ResultsOf the 192 HCW sampled, 52.1% were males and 78.7% are married, the median participants age was 34.4 years with interquartile range (IQR) of 11 years. Most participants had between 1-5 years of service while 43.8% had [&ge;]2 doses of HBV vaccine.

The respective prevalence of HBsAg, anti HBs and anti HBc was 18.8% (95% CI: 13.5-25.0%), 63.0% (95% CI: 55.8-69.9%) and 44.8% (95% CI: 37.6-52.1%). Higher proportion of HBV positive was found in HCW who had worked for less than one year and who had not received any dose of HBV vaccine at 37.5% and 35.9 % respectively.. Significant risk of HBV lifetime exposure was noted among HCW with one vaccine dose, those with no known exposure and highest in those with knowledge on HBV transmission (aOR, 7.97; 95% CI, 2.10-153.3, p-value=0.008). HCW who had received [&ge;]2 doses of HBV vaccine (aOR, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01-0.10, p-value= <0.0001) had significant HBV protection. Duration of service was not associated with HBV among HCW.

ConclusionPrevalence of HBV infection was high among HCW in Kisumu County. Ministry of health Kenya should strengthen comprehensive infection prevention and control practices to reduce lifetime exposure to HBV infection among HCW."

Research Design and MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study of 9-10-year-old participants and siblings across the United States. Data was obtained from the baseline assessment of the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study(R) in which brain structure was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging. Adiposity markers included age- and sex-specific body mass index (BMI z-scores), waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio. GDM exposure was self-reported, and discordance for GDM exposure within biological siblings was identified. Mixed effects and mediation models were used to examine associations between prenatal GDM exposure, brain structure, and adiposity markers with sociodemographic covariates.

ResultsThe sample included 8,521 children (age: 9.9{+/-}0.6 years; 51% males; 7% GDM-exposed), among whom there were 28 sibling pairs discordant for GDM exposure. Across the entire study sample, prenatal exposure to GDM was associated with lower global and regional cortical gray matter volume (GMV) in the bilateral rostral middle frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus. In a subset of sample only including siblings, GDM-exposed siblings also demonstrated lower global cortical GMV than un-exposed siblings. Global cortical GMV partially mediated the associations between prenatal GDM exposure and child adiposity markers.

ConclusionsOur results establish robust and generalizable brain markers of prenatal GDM exposure and suggest that low cortical GMV may explain increased obesity risk for offspring prenatally exposed to GDM.

10.1101/2022.05.25.22275561,"Streptococcus species abundance in the gut is linked to subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in 8,973 participants from the SCAPIS cohort","BACKGROUNDGut microbiota have been implicated in atherosclerotic disease, but their relation with subclinical coronary atherosclerosis is unclear. This study aimed to identify associations between the gut microbiome and computed tomography-based measures of coronary atherosclerosis, and to explore relevant clinical correlates.

METHODSWe conducted a cross-sectional study of 8973 participants aged 50 to 65 without overt atherosclerotic disease from the population-based Swedish Cardiopulmonary BioImage Study (SCAPIS). Coronary atherosclerosis was measured using coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Gut microbiota species abundance and functional potential were assessed with shotgun metagenomics sequencing of stool samples, and their association with coronary atherosclerosis was evaluated with multivariable regression models adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors. Associated species were evaluated for association with inflammatory markers, metabolites, and corresponding species in saliva.

RESULTSThe mean age of the study sample was 57.4 years, and 53.7% were female. Coronary artery calcification was detected in 40.3% of participants, and 5.4% had at least one stenosis with more than 50% occlusion. Sixty-four species were associated with CACS independent of cardiovascular risk factors, with the strongest associations observed for Streptococcus anginosus and S. oralis subsp. oralis (P<1x10-5). Associations were largely similar across CCTA-based measurements. Out of the 64 species, 19 species, including streptococci and other species commonly found in the oral cavity, were associated with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein plasma concentrations and 16 with neutrophil counts. Oral species in the gut were negatively associated with plasma indole propionate and positively associated with plasma secondary bile acids and imidazole propionate. Five species correlated with the same species in saliva and were associated with worse dental health in the Malmo Offspring Dental Study. Microbial functional potential of dissimilatory nitrate reduction, anaerobic fatty acid beta-oxidation and amino acid degradation was associated with CACS.

CONCLUSIONSThis study provides evidence of an association of a gut microbiota composition characterized by increased abundance of Streptococcus spp. and other species commonly found in the oral cavity with coronary atherosclerosis and systemic inflammation. Further longitudinal and experimental studies are warranted to explore the potential implication of a bacterial component in atherogenesis.

10.1101/2023.01.06.23284273,A simplification of the Kaiser Permanente inpatient risk adjustment methodology accurately predicted in-hospital mortality: A retrospective cohort study,"ObjectiveWe simplified and evaluated the Kaiser Permanente inpatient risk adjustment methodology (KP method) to predict in-hospital mortality, using open-source tools to measure comorbidity and diagnosis groups, and removing troponin, which is difficult to standardize across clinical assays.

Study Design and SettingRetrospective cohort study of adult general medical inpatients at 7 hospitals in Ontario, Canada.

ResultsIn 206,155 unique hospitalizations with 6.9% in-hospital mortality, the simplified KP method accurately predicted the risk of mortality. Bias-corrected c-statistics were 0.874 (95%CI 0.872-0.877) with troponin and 0.873 (95%CI 0.871-0.876) without troponin, and calibration was excellent for both approaches. Discrimination and calibration were similar with and without troponin for patients with heart failure and acute myocardial infarction. The Laboratory-based Acute Physiology Score (LAPS, a component of the KP method) predicted inpatient mortality on its own with and without troponin with bias-corrected c-statistics of 0.687 (95%CI 0.682-0.692) and 0.680 (95%CI 0.675-0.685), respectively. LAPS was well calibrated, except at very high scores.

ConclusionA simplification of the KP method accurately predicted in-hospital mortality risk in an external general medicine cohort. Without troponin, and using common open-source tools, the KP method can be implemented for risk adjustment in a wider range of settings."

We estimated VE of primary vaccination, and first and second booster vaccination, against SARS-CoV-2 infection overall, and in four risk groups defined by age and medical risk condition, in the Delta and Omicron BA.1/BA.2 periods.

MethodsVASCO is an ongoing prospective cohort study among vaccinated and unvaccinated Dutch adults. The primary endpoint was a self-reported positive SARS-CoV-2 test during 12 July 2021-6 June 2022. Participants with a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on a positive test or serology, were excluded. We used Cox proportional hazard models with vaccination status as time-varying exposure and adjustment for age, sex, educational level, and medical risk condition. We stratified by Delta and Omicron BA.1/BA.2 periods, risk group, and time since vaccination.

Results37,170 participants (mean age 57 years) were included. In the Delta period, VE <6 weeks after primary vaccination was 80% (95%CI 69-87) and decreased to 71% (65-77) after 6 months. VE increased to 96% (86-99) shortly after the first booster vaccination. In the Omicron period these estimates were 46% (22-63), 25% (8-39) and 57% (52-62), respectively. VE was 50% (34-62) <6 weeks after a second booster vaccination in participants aged [&ge;]60 years. For the Omicron period, an interaction term between vaccination status and risk group significantly improved the model (p<0.001), with generally lower VEs for those with a medical risk condition.

ConclusionsOur results show the benefit of booster vaccinations against infection, also in risk groups, although the additional protection wanes quite rapidly.

SummaryThis prospective cohort study contributes to vaccine policy of COVID-19 by showing the benefit of booster vaccination in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections, also in risk groups in which protection was generally lower, although the additional protection was rather short-lived."

Here, we report vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19-caused hospitalization and intensive care treatment during the Omicron wave.

MethodsWe analyzed data from 276 cases with COVID-19 and 494 control patients recruited in 13 hospitals from 1 December 2021 to 5 September 2022. We calculated crude and confounder-adjusted VE estimates.

Results21% of cases (57/276) were not vaccinated, compared to 5% of controls (26/494; p < 0.001). Confounder-adjusted VE against COVID-19-caused hospitalization was 55.4% (95% CI: 12-78%), 81.5% (95% CI: 68-90%) and 95.6% (95%CI: 88-99%) after two, three and four vaccine doses, respectively. VE against hospitalization due to COVID-19 remained stable up to one year after three vaccine doses.

ConclusionThree vaccine doses remained highly effective in preventing severe disease and this protection was sustained; a fourth dose further increased protection.

MethodsData from 365 bankers from five public and private banks in Bangladesh were collected using a pretested semistructured questionnaire. Prehypertension was defined as having systolic blood pressure of 120-139 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of 80-89 mmHg. Multivariate logistic regression models were created to investigate the factors associated with them.

ResultsThe prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension and prehypertension were 22.5% and 55.3%, respectively. Most of the bankers were males and 35-44 years of age. The risk of hypertension and prehypertension was significantly higher among males (OR, 16.59; OR, 6.42), longer duration of services (F, 3.56), prolonged working hours (OR, 3.8; OR, 3.09), smoking (OR, 6.18; OR, 3.43), overweight (OR, 6.81; OR, 2.41) and obese (OR, 8.94; OR, 3.36) bankers, respectively. After controlling for all confounders, the predictors of hypertension were males (aOR, 12.8; CI, 2.73-60.02), current smokers (aOR,2.87; CI, 1.03-8), overweight (aOR,5.11; CI, 1.46-17.93), and obesity (aOR, 9.59; CI, 2.41-38.22). For prehypertension, males (aOR, 9.72; CI, 3.06-30.87) and obesity (aOR, 3.95; CI, 1.52-10.25) were found as predictors.

ConclusionMore than three fourth of bankers in Bangladesh have either undiagnosed hypertension or prehypertension associated with several contributing factors to occur. A large-scale study is recommended to understand the clear picture of the overall NCD risk factors burden among bankers in Bangladesh.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICThe prevalence of hypertension and prehypertension are already higher in Bangladesh. Sedentary lifestyles and work stress make bankers a vulnerable community to developing these NCD risk factors.

10.1101/2023.01.09.23284342,"Effectiveness of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infections among healthcare personnel in Pakistan: a test-negative, case-control study.","ObjectiveDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, several vaccines that were efficacious in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were authorized for mass vaccination. In developing countries, inactivated vaccines were widely administered. While inactivated vaccines have been deemed effective in reducing disease severity, for healthcare personnel (HCPs), effectiveness against COVID-19 infections is also essential to reduce the risk to vulnerable patients and ensure a stable healthcare workforce. In addition, there are limited studies examining inactivated vaccines effectiveness against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in real-world settings. We aimed to estimate the effectiveness of inactivated vaccines (BBIBP-CorV and CoronaVac) against RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infections among HCPs in the setting of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in Pakistan.

Design, setting and participantsA retrospective matched test-negative case-control analysis of existing data of HCPs at a private healthcare system in Pakistan.

MethodsHCPs tested between April 1 and September 30, 2021, were included. Each case was matched to two to six controls by the date of the RT-PCR test ({+/-} 7 days) to reduce bias. We compared demographics, reasons for testing, and vaccination status between cases and controls using chi-square for categorical variables and t-test for continuous-level data. The odds of getting a PCR-confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection were calculated using conditional logistic regression, after adjusting for age, gender, and work area. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated as percent VE using (1-OR)*100.

ResultsInactivated vaccines were ineffective against COVID-19 infections [&ge;] 14 days after receiving the first dose [VE: 20% (95% CI: -10, 41; p=0.162)]. The vaccines showed modest effectiveness [&ge;] 14 days after the second dose against COVID-19 infections [VE: 33% (95% CI: 11, 50; p=0.006)], and symptomatic COVID-19 infections [VE: 36% (95% CI: 10, 54; p=0.009)].

ConclusionsInactivated vaccines show modest effectiveness against COVID-19 infections in the setting of emerging VOCs. This builds a strong case for boosters and/or additional vaccination."
10.1101/2023.01.19.23284803,Evaluation of Potential Adverse Events Following COVID-19 mRNA Vaccination Among Adults Aged 65 Years and Older: A Self-Controlled Study in the U.S.,"BackgroundOur near-real-time safety monitoring of 16 adverse events (AEs) following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination identified potential elevations in risk for six AEs following primary series and monovalent booster dose administration. The crude association with AEs does not imply causality. Accordingly, we conducted robust evaluations of the potential associations.

MethodsWe conducted self-controlled case series studies of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273) in U.S. Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. Adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated following primary series doses for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pulmonary embolism (PE), immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); and following booster doses for AMI, PE, ITP, Bell  s Palsy (BP) and Myocarditis/Pericarditis (Myo/Peri).

ResultsAmong 3,360,981 individuals who received 6,388,542 primary series doses and 6,156,100 individuals with monovalent booster doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, AE counts were: AMI (3,653 primary series, 16,042 booster), inpatient PE (2,470 primary, 5,085 booster), ITP (1,085 primary, 88 booster), DIC (254 primary), BP (3,268 booster), and Myo/Peri (1,295 booster). The IRR for inpatient PE cases following BNT162b2 primary series and booster was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.38) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.78 to 0.95), respectively; and for mRNA-1273 primary series and booster, 1.15 (95% CI: 0.94 to 1.41) and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.79 to 0.96), respectively. The IRR for BP following BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 booster was 1.17 (95% CI: 1.06 to 1.29) and 1.16 (95% CI: 1.05 to 1.29), respectively.

ConclusionIn these two studies of the U.S. elderly we did not find an increased risk for AMI, ITP, DIC, and Myo/Peri; the results were not consistent for PE; and there was a small elevated risk of BP after exposure to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. These results support the favorable safety profile of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines administered in the elderly.

HIGHLIGHTSThere was no increased risk for four of six outcomes following COVID-19 monovalent mRNA vaccines. There was a small elevated risk of Bell  s Palsy after exposure to COVID-19 monovalent mRNA vaccines. Risk of pulmonary embolism was not consistent after exposure to COVID-19 monovalent mRNA vaccines."

As a result, relatively little is known about the epidemiology or performance characteristics of clinical testing in this group.

METHODSWe retrospectively extracted and analyzed results for pediatric mpox specimens tested at a national reference laboratory from July to December 2022.

RESULTSDuring our study period 13.4% (2,063/15,385) of specimens were from individuals <18 years of age. The positivity rate of pediatric specimens was significantly lower than in adults (1.3% vs 22.3%). The pediatric cohort also consisted of a higher percentage of females (42.7% vs 31.0%) and lower percentage of specimens from genital sources (9.0% vs 19.7%) as compared to adults. In children, specimens were most frequently collected from 1-year-olds (10.1%) and least frequently from 11-year-olds (3.5%). Positivity rates were disproportionately elevated in the less than 1-year and 17-year-old age groups (7.8% and 6.4%, respectively). Ct values of positive cases were not statistically different between pediatric and adult cohorts (25.2 vs 22.2, p>0.05). When all pediatric cases with an initial positive mpox result were examined, 5/26 were classified as inconclusive and 2/26 were determined to be false positives. Based on these results, the positive predictive value of monkeypox virus detection was 90.5% (95% CI: 70.4-97.4%) in children.

CONCLUSIONThese results highlight important differences between pediatric and adult mpox populations and reinforce the need for clinical correlation when reporting positive results from a low prevalence population."

MethodsIn a Danish nationwide cohort study from 1 January 2021 to 10 December 2022, we examined the association between bivalent omicron-containing mRNA-booster vaccination as a fourth Covid-19 vaccine dose and risk of adverse events in individuals aged [&ge;]50 years. Using incidence rate ratios estimated with Poisson regression, we compared the rates of hospital visits for 27 different adverse events in a 28-day main risk period following vaccination with a bivalent omicron-containing mRNA-booster vaccine as a fourth dose to reference period rates from day 29 after the third or fourth vaccine dose and onward. Secondary analyses included stratifying by sex, age, and vaccine type and assessing the associations using self-controlled case series and observed vs. expected cohort analyses.

Results1,740,417 individuals (mean age 67.8 years, standard deviation 10.7) received a bivalent omicron-containing mRNA-booster vaccine as a fourth dose. Fourth dose vaccination with a bivalent omicron-containing booster did not statistically significantly increase the rate of any of the 27 adverse outcomes within 28 days, nor when analyzed according to age, sex, vaccine type, or using alternative analytical approaches. However, post-hoc analysis detected signals for myocarditis (statistically significantly so in females), although the outcome was very rare and findings were based on few cases. No risk of cerebrovascular infarction was found.

ConclusionsBivalent omicron-containing mRNA-booster vaccination as a fourth dose was not associated with an increased risk of 27 different adverse events in 50+-year-olds."

Obesity drives a myriad of metabolic perturbations in individuals and is a risk factor for multiple chronic diseases. Here, we report a global atlas of cross-sectional and longitudinal changes in 1,111 blood analytes associated with variation in Body Mass Index (BMI), as well as the multiomic associations with host polygenic risk scores and gut microbiome composition, from a cohort of 1,277 individuals enrolled in a wellness program. Machine learning model predictions of BMI from blood multiomics captured heterogeneous phenotypic states of host metabolism and gut microbiome composition, better than classically-measured BMI. Moreover, longitudinal analyses identified variable BMI trajectories for different omics measures in response to a healthy lifestyle intervention; metabolomics-inferred BMI decreased to a greater extent than actual BMI, while proteomics-inferred BMI exhibited greater resistance to change. Our analyses further revealed blood analyte-analyte associations that were significantly modified by metabolomics-inferred BMI and partially reversed in the metabolically obese population during the intervention. Taken together, our findings provide a blood atlas of the molecular perturbations associated with changes in obesity status, serving as a valuable resource to robustly quantify metabolic health for predictive and preventive medicine."
10.1101/2023.01.24.23284917,Modeling the impact of xenointoxication in dogs to halt Trypanosoma cruzi transmission,"BackgroundChagas disease, a vector-borne parasitic disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, affects millions in the Americas. Dogs are important reservoirs of the parasite. Under laboratory conditions, canine treatment with the systemic insecticide fluralaner demonstrated efficacy in killing Triatoma infestans and T. brasiliensis, T. cruzi vectors, when they feed on dogs. This form of pest control is called xenointoxication. However, T. cruzi can also be transmitted orally when mammals ingest infected bugs, so there is potential for dogs to become infected upon consuming infected bugs killed by the treatment. Xenointoxication thereby has two contrasting effects on dogs: decreasing the number of insects feeding on the dogs but increasing opportunities for exposure to T. cruzi via oral transmission to dogs ingesting infected insects.

ObjectiveExamine the potential for increased infection rates of T. cruzi in dogs following xenointoxication.

Design/MethodsWe built a deterministic mathematical model, based on the Ross-MacDonald malaria model, to investigate the net effect of fluralaner treatment on the prevalence of T. cruzi infection in dogs in different epidemiologic scenarios. We drew upon published data on the change in percentage of bugs killed that fed on treated dogs over days post treatment. Parameters were adjusted to mimic three scenarios of T. cruzi transmission: high and low disease prevalence and domestic vectors, and low disease prevalence and sylvatic vectors.

ResultsIn regions with high endemic disease prevalence in dogs and domestic vectors, prevalence of infected dogs initially increases but subsequently declines before eventually rising back to the initial equilibrium following one fluralaner treatment. In regions of low prevalence and domestic or sylvatic vectors, however, treatment seems to be detrimental. In these regions our models suggest a potential for a rise in dog prevalence, due to oral transmission from dead infected bugs.

ConclusionXenointoxication could be a beneficial and novel One Health intervention in regions with high prevalence of T. cruzi and domestic vectors. In regions with low prevalence and domestic or sylvatic vectors, there is potential harm. Field trials should be carefully designed to closely follow treated dogs and include early stopping rules if incidence among treated dogs exceeds that of controls.

Author summaryChagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is transmitted via triatomine insect vectors. In Latin America, dogs are a common feeding source for triatomine vectors and subsequently an important reservoir of T. cruzi. One proposed intervention to reduce T. cruzi transmission is xenointoxication: treating dogs with oral insecticide to kill triatomine vectors in order to decrease overall T. cruzi transmission. Fluralaner, commonly administered to prevent ectoparasites such as fleas and ticks, is effective under laboratory conditions against the triatomine vectors. One concern with fluralaner treatment is that rapid death of the insect vectors may make the insects more available to oral ingestion by dogs; a more effective transmission pathway than stercorarian, the usual route for T. cruzi transmission. Using a mathematical model, we explored 3 different epidemiologic scenarios: high prevalence endemic disease within a domestic T. cruzi cycle, low prevalence endemic disease within a domestic T. cruzi cycle, and low prevalence endemic disease within a semi-sylvatic T. cruzi cycle. We found a range of beneficial to detrimental effects of fluralaner xenointoxication depending on the epidemiologic scenario. Our results suggest that careful field trials should be designed and carried out before wide scale implementation of fluralaner xenointoxication to reduce T. cruzi transmission."

Few attempts have been made to pattern the time of physical activity while incorporating intensity and duration in order to determine the relationship of this multi-faceted behavior with health. In this paper, we explore a distance-based approach for clustering daily physical activity time series to estimate temporal physical activity patterns among U.S. adults (ages 20-65) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006 (NHANES). A number of distance measures and distance-based clustering methods were investigated and compared using various metrics. These metrics include the Silhouette and the Dunn Index (internal criteria), and the associations of the clusters with health status indicators (external criteria). Our experiments indicate that using a distance-based cluster analysis approach to estimate temporal physical activity patterns through the day, has the potential to describe the complexity of behavior rather than characterizing physical activity patterns solely by sums or labels of maximum activity levels."

DesignRetrospective cohort study of non-hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19 using the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank.

SettingA real-world cohort study was conducted within the SAIL Databank (a secure trusted research environment containing anonymised, individual, population-scale electronic health record (EHR) data) for the population of Wales, UK.

ParticipantsAdult patients with COVID-19 in the community, at higher risk of hospitalisation and death, testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 16th December 2021 and 22nd April 2022.

InterventionsMolnupiravir, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, and sotrovimab given in the community by local health boards and the National Antiviral Service in Wales.

Main outcome measuresAll-cause admission to hospital or death within 28 days of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2.

Statistical analysisCox proportional hazard model with treatment status (treated/untreated) as a time-dependent covariate and adjusted for age, sex, number of comorbidities, Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation, and vaccination status. Secondary subgroup analyses were by treatment type, number of comorbidities, and before and on or after 20th February 2022, when omicron BA.1 and omicron BA.2 were the dominant subvariants in Wales.

ResultsBetween 16th December 2021 and 22nd April 2022, 7,103 higher-risk patients were eligible for inclusion in the study. Of these, 2,040 received treatment with molnupiravir (359, 17.6%), nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (602, 29.5%), or sotrovimab (1,079, 52.9%). Patients in the treatment group were younger (mean age 53 vs 57 years), had fewer comorbidities, and a higher proportion had received four or more doses of the COVID-19 vaccine (36.3% vs 17.6%).

Within 28 days of a positive test, 628 (9.0%) patients were admitted to hospital or died (84 treated and 544 untreated). The primary analysis indicated a lower risk of hospitalisation or death at any point within 28 days in treated participants compared to those not receiving treatment. The adjusted hazard rate was 35% (95% CI: 18-49%) lower in treated than untreated participants. There was no indication of the superiority of one treatment over another and no evidence of a reduction in risk of hospitalisation or death within 28 days for patients with no or only one comorbidity. In patients treated with sotrovimab, the event rates before and on or after 20th February 2022 were similar (5.0% vs 4.9%) with no significant difference in the hazard ratios for sotrovimab between the time periods.

ConclusionsIn higher-risk adult patients in the community with COVID-19, those who received treatment with molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, or sotrovimab were at lower risk of hospitalisation or death than those not receiving treatment."

As multiple exposures can jointly impact health, here we: i) demonstrate how to extend SLCMA to include exposure interactions; ii) conduct a simulation study investigating the performance of these methods; and iii) apply these methods to explore associations of access to green space, and its interaction with socioeconomic position, with child cardiometabolic health.

MethodsWe used three methods, all based on lasso regression, to select the most plausible life course model: visual inspection, information criteria and cross-validation. The simulation study assessed the ability of these approaches to detect the correct interaction term, while varying parameters which may impact power (e.g., interaction magnitude, sample size, exposure collinearity). Methods were then applied to data from a UK birth cohort.

ResultsThere were trade-offs between false negatives and false positives in detecting the true interaction term for different model selection methods. Larger sample size, lower exposure collinearity, centering exposures, continuous outcomes and a larger interaction effect all increased power. In our applied example we found little-to-no association between access to green space, or its interaction with socioeconomic position, and child cardiometabolic outcomes.

ConclusionsIncorporating interactions between multiple exposures is an important extension to SLCMA. The choice of method depends on the researchers assessment of the risks of under-vs over-fitting. These results also provide guidance for improving power to detect interactions using these methods.

Key messagesO_LIIn life course epidemiology, it is important to consider how multiple exposures over the lifespan may jointly influence health.
C_LIO_LIWe demonstrate how to extend current structured life course modelling approaches to include interactions between multiple different exposures.
C_LIO_LIA simulation study comparing different methods to detect a true interaction effect found a trade-off between false positives and false negatives, suggesting that the optimal choice of method may depend on the researchers assessment of this trade-off (e.g., exploratory studies may prefer a greater risk of false positives, while confirmatory studies may prefer to minimise the risk of false positives).
C_LIO_LIWe identified key factors that improve power to detect a true interaction effect, namely larger sample sizes, centering exposures, lower exposure collinearity, continuous outcomes and larger interaction effect sizes.
C_LIO_LIWe applied these methods in a UK birth cohort (ALSPAC; Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children), finding little-to-no evidence of an association between access to green space and its interaction with socioeconomic position on child BMI, obesity or blood pressure.

10.1101/2021.03.16.21253603,Faecal shedding models for SARS-CoV-2 RNA amongst hospitalised patients and implications for wastewater-based epidemiology,"SummaryThe concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in faeces is not well established, posing challenges for wastewater-based surveillance of COVID-19 and risk assessments of environmental transmission. We develop versatile hierarchical models for faecal RNA shedding and apply them to data collected in six studies. We find that the mean number of gene copies per mL of faeces is 1.9 x 106 (2.3 x 105-2.0 x 108 95% credible interval) among unvaccinated hospitalised patients. Using Bayesian model comparison, we find no evidence for a subpopulation of patients who do not shed RNA: limits of quantification can account for negative stool samples. Our models indicate that hospitalised patients represent the tail of the shedding profile with a half-life of 34 hours (28-43 95% credible interval), suggesting that wastewater-based surveillance signals are more indicative of incidence than prevalence and can be a leading indicator of clinical presentation. Shedding among inpatients cannot explain high RNA concentrations observed in wastewater, consistent with more abundant shedding during the early infection course. We show that the models generalise and can predict summary statistics of held-out clinical datasets. However, shedding prior to hospitalisation cannot be constrained due to lack of samples, and information on viral variants was not available."

We analysed isolation and quarantine orders by the local public health agency in Berlin-Reinickendorf (Germany) and their dependence on the recommendations by the Robert Koch Institute, the national public health institute. Between 3 March 2020 and 18 December 2021 the local public health agency ordered 24603 isolations and 45014 quarantines (mean contacts per case 1.9). More days of quarantine per 100 inhabitants were ordered for children than for adults: 4.1 for children aged 0-6, 5.2 for children aged 7-17, 0.9 for adults aged 18-64 and 0.3 for elderly aged 65-110. The mean duration for isolation orders was 10.2 and for quarantine orders 8.2 days. We calculated a delay of 4 days between contact and quarantine order. 3484 of contact persons were in quarantine when they developed an infection. Our study quantifies isolation and quarantine orders, shows that children had been ordered to quarantine more than adults and that there were fewer school days lost to isolation or quarantine as compared to school closures. Our results indicate that the recommendations of the Robert Koch Institute had an influence on isolation and quarantine duration as well as contact identification and that the local public health agency was not able to provide rigorous contact tracing, as the mean number of contacts was lower than expected."
10.1101/2023.01.23.23284722,Transformation of forecasts for evaluating predictive performance in an epidemiological context,"Forecast evaluation is essential for the development of predictive epidemic models and can inform their use for public health decision-making. Common scores to evaluate epidemiological forecasts are the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) and the Weighted Interval Score (WIS), which can be seen as measures of the absolute distance between the forecast distribution and the observation. However, applying these scores directly to predicted and observed incidence counts may not be the most appropriate due to the exponential nature of epidemic processes and the varying magnitudes of observed values across space and time. In this paper, we argue that transforming counts before applying scores such as the CRPS or WIS can effectively mitigate these difficulties and yield epidemiologically meaningful and easily interpretable results. Using the CRPS on log-transformed values as an example, we list three attractive properties: Firstly, it can be interpreted as a probabilistic version of a relative error. Secondly, it reflects how well models predicted the time-varying epidemic growth rate. And lastly, using arguments on variance-stabilizing transformations, it can be shown that under the assumption of a quadratic mean-variance relationship, the logarithmic transformation leads to expected CRPS values which are independent of the order of magnitude of the predicted quantity. Applying a transformation of log(x + 1) to data and forecasts from the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub, we find that it changes model rankings regardless of stratification by forecast date, location or target types. Situations in which models missed the beginning of upward swings are more strongly emphasised while failing to predict a downturn following a peak is less severely penalised when scoring transformed forecasts as opposed to untransformed ones. We conclude that appropriate transformations, of which the natural logarithm is only one particularly attractive option, should be considered when assessing the performance of different models in the context of infectious disease incidence."
10.1101/2022.09.05.22279599,Scaling rules for pandemics: Estimating infected fraction from identified cases for the SARS-Cov-2 Pandemic,"Using a modified form of the SIR model, we show that, under general conditions, all pandemics exhibit certain scaling rules. Using only daily data for symptomatic, confirmed cases, these scaling rules can be used to estimate: (i) reff, the effective pandemic R-parameter; (ii) ftot, the fraction of exposed individuals that were infected (symptomatic and asymptomatic); (iii) Leff, the effective latency, the average number of days an infected individual is able to infect others in the pool of susceptible individuals; and (iv) , the probability of infection per contact between infected and susceptible individuals. We validate the scaling rules using an example and then apply our method to estimate reff, ftot, Leff and  for the first phase of the SARS-Cov-2, Covid-19 pandemic for several countries where there was a well separated first peak in identified infected daily cases after the outbreak of the pandemic in early 2020. Our results are general and can be applied to any pandemic."
10.1101/2022.09.15.22279972,Distinct origins and transmission pathways of blaKPC Enterobacterales across three U.S. states,"BackgroundCarbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) are among the most concerning antibiotic resistance threats due to high rates of multidrug resistance, transmissibility in healthcare settings, and high mortality rates. We evaluated the potential for regional genomic surveillance to track blaKPC-carrying CRE (KPC-CRE) transmission across healthcare facilities in three U.S. states.

MethodsClinical isolates were collected from Connecticut (CT; 2017-2018), Minnesota (MN; 2012-2018), and Tennessee (TN; 2016-2017) through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Multi-site Gram-negative Surveillance Initiative and additional surveillance. KPC-CRE isolates were whole-genome sequenced, and case report data on patient comorbidities, healthcare utilization, and interfacility patient transfer were extracted.

FindingsIn CT, most KPC-CRE isolates showed evidence of importation from outside the state, with limited local transmission. In MN, cases were mainly from sporadic importation and transmission of blaKPC-carrying Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) ST258, and clonal expansion of an imported epidemic lineage of blaKPC-carrying Enterobacter hormaechei (KPC-Ec) ST171 primarily at a single focal facility and its satellite facilities. In TN, KPC-Kp ST258, and more recently emerged KPC-Kp ST307 and KPC-Eh ST114 were most common, with largely non-overlapping facility networks mediating the spread of ST258 versus ST307 and ST114.

ConclusionsThe underlying processes driving KPC-CRE burden can differ substantially across regions, and different STs can spread via distinct pathways within a region. Integrating genomic and epidemiological data from regional surveillance, and information on interfacility patient transfers, can provide insights to target interventions."
10.1101/2023.01.21.23284863,Improving the Prediction of Death from Cardiovascular Causes with Multiple Risk Markers,"BackgroundTraditional risk factors including demographics, blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes status are successfully able to predict a proportion of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Whether including additional routinely measured factors improves CVD prediction is unclear. To determine whether a comprehensive risk factor list, including clinical blood measures, blood counts, anthropometric measures, and lifestyle factors, improves prediction of CVD deaths beyond traditional factors.

MethodsThe analysis comprised of 21,982 participants aged 40 years and older (mean age=59.4 years at baseline) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2001 to 2016 survey cycles. Data were linked with the National Death Index mortality data through 2019 and split into 80:20 training and testing sets. Relative to the traditional risk factors (age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, antihypertensive medications, and diabetes), we compared models with an additional 22 clinical blood biomarkers, 20 complete blood counts, 7 anthropometric measures, 51 dietary factors, 13 cardiovascular health-related questions, and all 113 predictors together. To build prediction models for CVD mortality, we performed Cox proportional hazards regression, elastic-net (ENET) penalized Cox regression, and random survival forest, and compared classification using C-index and net reclassification improvement.

ResultsDuring follow-up (median, 9.3 years), 3,075 participants died; 30.9% (1,372/3,075) deaths were from cardiovascular causes. In Cox proportional hazards models with traditional risk factors (C-index=0.850), CVD mortality classification improved with incorporation of clinical blood biomarkers (C-index=0.867), blood counts (C-index=0.861), and all predictors (C-index=0.871). Net CVD mortality reclassification improved 13.2% by adding clinical blood biomarkers and 12.2% by adding all predictors. Results for ENET-penalized Cox regression and random survival forest were similar. No improvement was observed in separate models for anthropometric measures, dietary nutrient intake, or cardiovascular health-related questions.

ConclusionsThe addition of clinical blood biomarkers and blood counts substantially improves CVD mortality prediction, beyond traditional risk factors. These biomarkers may serve as an important clinical and public health screening tool for the prevention of CVD deaths.

However, the clinical effectiveness of Azvudine in real-world studies was lacking, despite the clinical trials showed shorter time of nucleic acid negative conversion. To evaluate the clinical effectiveness following Azvudine treatment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we identified 1505 hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the study period, with a follow-up of up to 29 days. After exclusions and propensity score matching, we included 226 Azvudine recipients and 226 matched controls. The lower crude incidence rate of composite disease progression outcome (4.21 vs. 10.39 per 1000 person-days, P=0.041) and all-cause mortality (1.57 vs. 6.00 per 1000 person-days, P=0.027) were observed among Azvudine recipients compared with matched controls. The incidence rates of initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation were also statistically different between the groups according to the log-rank tests (P=0.020). Azvudine treatment was associated with significantly lower risks of composite disease progression outcome (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.18 to 0.99) and all-cause death (HR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.94) compared with matched controls. Subgroup analyses indicated robustness of the point estimates of HRs (ranged from 0.14 to 0.84). Notably, male Azvudine recipients had a stronger effectiveness than female recipients with respect to both composite outcome and all-cause death. These findings suggest that Azvudine treatment showed substantial clinical benefits in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and should be considered for use in this population of patients."
10.1101/2023.01.22.23284878,Wastewater-based surveillance can be used to model COVID-19-associated workforce absenteeism,"Wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) is a powerful tool for understanding community COVID-19 disease burden and informing public health policy. The potential of WBS for understanding COVID-19s impact in non-healthcare settings has not been explored to the same degree. Here we examined how SARS-CoV-2 measured from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) correlates with local workforce absenteeism. SARS-CoV-2 RNA N1 and N2 were quantified three times per week by RT-qPCR in samples collected at three WWTPs servicing Calgary and surrounding areas, Canada (1.3 million residents) between June 2020 and March 2022. Wastewater trends were compared to workforce absenteeism using data from the largest employer in the city (>15,000 staff). Absences were classified as being COVID-19-related, COVID-19-confirmed, and unrelated to COVID-19. Poisson regression was performed to generate a prediction model for COVID-19 absenteeism based on wastewater data. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 95.5% (85/89) of weeks assessed. During this period 6592 COVID-19-related absences (1896 confirmed) and 4,524 unrelated absences COVID-19 cases were recorded. Employee absences significantly increased as wastewater signal increased through the pandemics waves. Strong correlations between COVID-19-confirmed absences and wastewater SARS-CoV-2 signals (N1 gene: r=0.824, p<0.0001 and N2 gene: r=0.826, p<0.0001) were observed. Linear regression with adjusted R2-value demonstrated a robust association (adjusted R2=0.783), when adjusted by 7 days, indicating wastewater provides a one-week leading signal. A generalized linear regression using a Poisson distribution was performed to predict COVID-19-confirmed absences out of the total number of absent employees using wastewater data as a leading indicator (P<0.0001). We also assessed the variation of predictions when the regression model was applied to new data, with the predicted values and corresponding confidence intervals closely tracking actual absenteeism data. Wastewater-based surveillance has the potential to be used by employers to anticipate workforce requirements and optimize human resource allocation in response to trackable respiratory illnesses like COVID-19.

10.1101/2023.01.12.23284479,Comparison of different isolation periods for preventing the spread of COVID-19: a rapid systematic review and a modelling study,"BackgroundThe optimal isolation duration for COVID-19 patients remains unclear. To support an update of WHO Living Clinical management guidelines for COVID-19 (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-clinical-2022.2), this rapid systematic review and modelling study addresses the effects of different isolation periods for preventing onward transmission leading to hospitalization and death among secondary cases.

MethodsWe searched World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 database for clinical studies evaluating the impact of isolation periods for COVID-19 patients up to July 28, 2022. We performed random-effects meta-analyses to summarize testing rates of persistent test positivity rates after COVID-19 infection. We developed a model to compare the effects of the five-day isolation and removal of isolation based on a negative antigen test with ten-day isolation on onward transmission leading to hospitalization and death. We assumed that patients with a positive test are infectious and those with a negative test are not. If the test becomes negative, patients will stay negative. The model included estimates of test positivity rates, effective reproduction number, and hospitalization rate or case fatality rate.

FindingsTwelve studies addressing persistent test positivity rates including 2799 patients proved eligible. Asymptomatic patients (27.1%, 95% CI: 15.8% to 40.0%) had a significantly lower rapid antigen test (RAT) positive rate than symptomatic patients (68.1%, 95% CI: 40.6% to 90.3%) on day 5. The RAT positive rate was 21.5% (95% CI: 0 to 64.1%; moderate certainty) on day 10. Our modelling study suggested that the risk difference (RD) for asymptomatic patients between five-day isolation and ten-day isolation in hospitalization (2 more hospitalizations of secondary cases per 1000 patients isolated, 95% uncertainty interval (UI) 2 more to 3 more) and mortality (1 more per 1000 patients, 95% UI 0 to 1 more) of secondary cases proved very small (very low certainty). For symptomatic patients, the potential impact of five- versus ten-day isolation was much greater in hospitalizations (RD 19 more per 1000 patients, 95% UI 14 more to 24 more; very low certainty) and mortality (RD 5 more per 1000 patients, 95% UI 4 more to 6 more; very low certainty). There may be no difference between removing isolation based on a negative antigen test and ten-day isolation in the onward transmission leading to hospitalization or death, but the average isolation period (mean difference -3 days) will be shorter for the removal of isolation based on a negative antigen test (moderate certainty).

InterpretationFive versus 10 days of isolation in asymptomatic patients may result in a small amount of onward transmission and negligible hospitalization and mortality, but in symptomatic patients concerning transmission and resulting hospitalization and mortality. The evidence is, however, very uncertain.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIsolating infected patients and quarantining individuals with a high risk of recent infection remain widely used strategies to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. There are no prior systematic reviews to evaluate effects relevant to decisions regarding protocols for ending COVID-19 isolation. Many modelling studies have, however, evaluated impact of five days of isolation or alternative strategies (e.g. 7 days and 10 days) with or without one negative lateral flow device on secondary infections or additional transmission risk. However, none has focused on the most patient-important outcomes - onward transmission leading to hospitalization or death. The optimal isolation duration for COVID-19 patients remains unclear. We searched WHO COVID-19 database for clinical studies evaluating the impact of isolation periods for COVID-19 patients up to July 28, 2022. We performed random-effects meta-analyses to summarize testing rates of persistent test positivity rates after COVID-19 infection. We used a model to compare the effects of the five-day isolation and removal of isolation based on a negative antigen test with ten-day isolation on onward transmission leading to hospitalization and death.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and modelling study to compare effects of the five-day isolation and removal of isolation based on a negative antigen test with ten-day isolation on most patient-important outcomes - onward transmission leading to hospitalization or death. This study demonstrates that for symptomatic patients the five-day isolation may increase onward transmission and thus hospitalization and mortality of secondary cases compared with the ten-day isolation by a magnitude most would consider important. For asymptomatic patients, the increase in hospitalizations and death may be small enough to be considered unimportant. Removal of isolation based on a negative antigen test will probably shorten the average isolation period compared with isolating all patients for 10 days.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that 5 versus 10 days of isolation in asymptomatic patients may result in a small amount of onward transmission and negligible hospitalization and mortality, but in symptomatic patients concerning transmission and resulting hospitalization and mortality."
